      "title": "Construction of Immigrant Mothers' Language Experiences in Taiwan: Mothering in One's Second Language Is a 'Choice'?",
      "summary": "This study uses life story interviews with immigrant mothers from Southeast Asia in Taiwan to examine their language choices and how these are shaped by immigration status, family dynamics, and life circumstances.  It challenges the notion that transmitting their native language is a simple choice, revealing it as a complex process influenced by social and national contexts. The study highlights the native tongues of these mothers as sites of both oppression and liberation.",

      "summary": "This qualitative study explores family language policy in Vietnamese immigrant families in Melbourne, Australia.  It examines the tensions between mothers' and children's language beliefs, focusing on the children's perspectives, which are often overlooked.  The study uses Fitzsimmons-Doolan's notions of pro-multilingual and pro-monolingual ideologies and Bourdieu's concept of capital to analyze the differing viewpoints and their implications for family language policy.",
