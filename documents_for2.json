      "summary": "This qualitative study explores parents' perceptions of how external stakeholders (e.g., SLPs, teachers) contribute to the rejection or abandonment of AAC systems in children with complex communication needs.  Through interviews with 12 parents, four themes emerged: influence of professional attitudes, lack of SLP support, ineffective communication between stakeholders, and difficulties using AAC without community support. The study emphasizes the importance of family-centered service delivery in AAC implementation.",

      "title": "STEM Education in Early Childhood: A Review of Empirical Studies",
      "summary": "This study reviews empirical studies on STEM education in early childhood.  It found positive attitudes towards STEM learning among young children and their parents, with parents also recognizing the economic benefits.  Teachers, however, expressed concerns about time constraints, resources, and their own capacity to implement STEM lessons effectively.  The study recommends a holistic STEM curriculum for teachers, including professional training, and additional training for parents on supporting their children's STEM learning.",

Using Lareau's 'accomplishment of natural growth' framework and data from 77 parents/caregivers, the research explores feelings of frustration, powerlessness, and distance from schools among working-class and poor families.  Case studies illustrate how this framework helps interpret these experiences, offering recommendations for policy and practice to promote equal access to educational engagement.",

Higher stress was linked to children's behavioral and emotional difficulties. Parental education level and teacher support influenced home activity frequency.  COVID-19 exposure was a risk factor for stress, while parental education, income, and teacher support were protective factors. Learning-focused activities showed an inverse association with parental stress.

A latent class analysis reveals that socioemotional well-being varies depending on origin and economic patterns, supporting both the immigrant risk and immigrant paradox perspectives.  Generally, immigrant children reported worse locus of control, self-concept, and internalizing symptoms than children of native-born parents, but this varied by origin and economic circumstances.  Children from South East and East Asia reported worse well-being than White children of native-born parents in chronic near-poor circumstances, while others fared similarly under similar conditions.",
