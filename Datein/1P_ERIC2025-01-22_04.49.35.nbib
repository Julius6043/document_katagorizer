AB  - Relative to parents of children with neurotypical development and other developmental disabilities, parents of autistic children experience higher levels of parenting stress, which are associated with deleterious consequences for parents' mental and physical health and child functioning. Despite urgent calls to action, parenting stress is rarely addressed directly in interventions for families of autistic children, and less so in underserved and racial/ethnic minority populations where clinical needs are greater. This study tested the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction, compared to a psychoeducation and support intervention, in reducing parenting stress among diverse families of autistic preschoolers. Participants (N = 117) were randomly assigned to the mindfulness-based stress reduction or psychoeducation and support groups; assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 6 and 12 months postintervention. Results indicated significant reductions in parenting stress across both the mindfulness-based stress reduction and psychoeducation and support intervention conditions; however, reductions in parenting stress were greater for parents in mindfulness-based stress reduction than in psychoeducation and support. Furthermore, the benefit of mindfulness-based stress reduction relative to psychoeducation and support increased over time, with significant group differences in parenting stress detected at 12-month follow-up.

AB  - This case study of families of first-generation college students, drawing from multiple data sources including longitudinal data from 8 parents who were interviewed three times over the span of their students' first college year and focus group data with parents attending college orientation, expands our understanding of parent and family engagement in students' college experiences. This qualitative study also offers insight into parents' views of and interactions with college, which are informed by direct communication with parents as well as students sharing stories and information about their experiences in college with their parents. Key themes include: 1) valuing a college degree, 2) changing relationship dynamics, 3) changing roles and dynamics, 4) changing involvement in educational events, and 5) institutional engagement of parents. With this knowledge, strategies can be developed to foster and support what parents are already doing well and address any gaps in resources, support, or information -- whether on behalf of parents or the institution.

AB  - Emergencies disrupt education service delivery; recent global political developments, environmental disasters, and the emergence of new diseases underscore the need for governments and education systems to learn from past crises to better prepare for future challenges. This qualitative study captures the perspectives of Kazakhstani parents as they navigated the difficulties posed by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and school closures. Interviews with 30 parents from different social backgrounds, geographical locations, family types, and employment situations revealed significant challenges. Utilizing the Balance Between Risks and Resources and Family Systems Theory, the study found that parents faced job losses, reduced income, and increased childcare responsibilities as schools swiftly transitioned to online learning. Gender inequity was particularly evident, with most educational support falling on mothers, who often felt unqualified to facilitate online schooling. Compounding these issues were poor internet access and the necessity of sharing a single device among multiple family members. Prolonged social isolation left many mothers feeling emotionally drained, with confined living spaces further impacting their well-being. Educational inequities widened and varied significantly along residential locations. To effectively address future emergencies and the long-term impacts of COVID-19, governments must ensure equitable digital access, provide financial and emotional support to families in need, offer technology training for parents and address unequal gender norms surrounding childcare and domestic labor. These steps will help build a stronger education system that meets the needs of all stakeholders and is better equipped to withstand future crises.

AB  - As part of an ethnographic study on young people and learning (the knowledge in motion across contexts of learning project, set in Norway), we interviewed a diverse sample of parents of young teenagers, many of whom were active in organized sports. The parents described their level of involvement in sport in a way that contrasted sharply to our own experiences participating in youth sports in the 1970s and 1980s. Back then most parents were absent from the sports fields. This new role of sports in the practice of parenthood is what we investigate in this study. The purpose is to further the understanding of the cultural processes that drive what we see as a marked generational change in the relationship between organized sports and the practice of parenthood. In contrast to previous studies, we also focus on the relationship between generational change and classed patterns in parenting. Our data suggest that across social classes, parents see involvement in sports as normal, and as a way to connect to the child emotionally and to further the child's development. We interpret the significance of sports in the parent-child relationship as related both to the normalization of youth sports that the parents experienced when they grew up, and to the new cultural ideas of parenthood that they encounter as adults. We find that there are tensions embedded in this new form of parenthood that are particularly evident in what we call 'deep involvement', an intensified form of parental engagement with youth sports that is practiced primarily by fathers in the economic fraction of the middle class. We conclude that the new role of sport in the practice of parenthood is a classed as well as a generational phenomenon.

AB  - This small-scale study examines the experiences encountered by a group of parents in their endeavours to support their children to settle and thrive, both in family life and school. The study identifies how a 'complex tapestry of relationships' exists both within and beyond adoptive families, which influences children's developmental and educational outcomes. Conflicting relationships emerged between: foster carers and adoptive parents, paired siblings, and adoptive parents and teachers. Enhanced understanding of the complexities and tensions which may exist will help school practitioners to identify approaches and strategies that can be used with children and families to promote adopted children's self-identity, well-being and their capacity to function and learn inside classrooms.

AB  - As early childhood education programs in the United States increasingly serve a growing number of children from linguistically and culturally diverse families, understanding teacher practices to better serve these families continues to be an important focus for the profession. In programs that serve migrant farmworker families, little is known about teachers' communication practices and ways in which teachers promote parent engagement with migrant farmworker families. This article explores the practices of teachers relevant to family communication and engagement in Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs, a branch of Head Start program for farmworker families, mostly of Mexican origin. This study used qualitative methods of in-depth interviews and a focus group to bring forth the perspectives and lived experience of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking teachers working with farmworker families in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Key findings illustrate the role of shared language and culture, mediated language barriers, the reliability of interpreters and written communication, and authentic ways of creating home--school connections with the migrant farmworker community.

AB  - Objective: ADHD is subject to stigma from the general population. Exposure to stigma poses the risk of developing self-stigma of youth and parents, but few studies have focused on self-stigma of ADHD. Furthermore, parental factors have been implicated in self-stigma of youth, but no previous research has assessed the association between self-stigma of parents and youth. Therefore, the objective of this study was to better understand the experience of self-stigma of youth and their parents in the context of ADHD. Method: Fifty-five youth with ADHD (aged 8-17) and one parent reporter per youth completed surveys to report their experiences. Results: The results of this study found that both youth and parents reported significantly lower self-stigma scores compared to most previously published research. Parents of boys reported higher self-stigma scores compared to parents of girls. Youth who reported higher self-stigma also reported lower self-esteem. Self-stigma scores in youth were predicted by inattentive symptoms but not hyperactive/impulsive symptoms or parental self-stigma. Conclusion: Results emphasize the importance of understanding self-stigma of ADHD, symptom severity, and the need for interventions for families with ADHD.

AB  - Identifying family strengths is central to early childhood practices. Moving beyond identification to exploring and explicitly applying those strengths can evolve strengths-based and family capacity-building practices. Assessment and planning processes that focus on the strategies families use to help their child learn can give agency to families in this parenting role. This exploratory study examined the perspectives of seven families who participated in an early intervention assessment-to-planning approach that sought to uncover, understand, and utilize the strategies families used to help their child learn and their appraisals of those strategies. Family responses during qualitative interviews were analyzed into three themes: (1) naturalistic observations yield naturalistic understandings, (2) practices that honor family strengths and family fit, and (3) self-discovery and self-affirmation. Implications for evolving family capacity-building approaches are discussed.

AB  - Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are known to experience emotional hypo/hypersensitivity, aside from exhibiting restricted and repetitive behaviors. These behaviors prevent them from perceiving and simultaneously responding to environmental stimuli, meaning that they may not notice potential hazards. Children with ASD are in the risk group for home accidents, being unaware of the hazards, and are therefore open to environmental risks. The aim of this study is to determine the needs of families that have children with ASD for home safety skills and to test the effectiveness of the training program prepared. Qualitative, quantitative, and quantitative levels were carried out sequentially in this study conducted with a multilevel mixed design. The findings of the qualitative and quantitative levels revealed that the families were content with taking measures regarding only home accidents, and they were insufficient in providing education. In the last level, the program was effective in the experimental group, and the awareness of the families increased in the interviews. The program, which also aims to prevent home accidents to which children with special needs are exposed, can be applied to children with and without developmental disability through instructive booklets, animations, and videos.

AB  - The policy and educational ideal of parent-school engagement rests on assumptions about effective communication with parents about children's educational progress and well-being. Yet communication between school and home varies, and can be a source of parental satisfaction "and" frustration. Here we consider perspectives of Australian parents whose encounters with schools -- both satisfactory and unsatisfactory -- are shaped by the everyday communicative practices and conflict management strategies of teachers and principals. Our findings show that a wide range of parents of children in Australian schools report similar experiences, concerns and frustrations. Informed by cultural and post-structural theory, we consider how approaches to communication and conflict are implicated in disciplining the family and keeping parents 'in their place' outside schooling's structures of power. Participants in our research reveal the intensity of affective investments in education as a 'high stakes' endeavour. We argue that the rationality of education policy that is being embedded in the everyday social configurations of schools and their interaction with parents is predicated on the neoliberal project of producing the autonomous, self-governing individual. The communication practices used in disciplining the family by conscripting parents into this project, we suggest, is a significant contributor to un/satisfactory parent-school encounters.

AB  - Research on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has found significant disparities in access to services and outcomes in rural communities. Little is known about service providers and families of children with ASD who reside in rural communities. The purpose of this study was to learn and describe the barriers and unmet needs experienced by parents and providers providing support to children with ASD in rural communities through a life course perspective. Eight parents and eight service providers participated in the focus groups from rural counties in Illinois, United States. Parents discussed barriers to accessing and coordinating services, from ASD diagnosis to transition and future planning. Overall themes highlighted the scarcity of qualified professionals trained to work with and serve children and youth with ASD and the resourcefulness caregivers and providers need to fill the gaps in education, health care, transition, and future planning. We present recommendations shared by parents and providers on ways to improve access to services and support for families in rural areas. The current study reports important implications for policy and practice regarding services and support for families of children and youth with ASD residing in rural communities.

AB  - The number of Asian American children with autism is steadily increasing. Previous research reports that parents of children with autism experience higher stress compared with parents of typically developing children. Immigrant families of children with autism are particularly vulnerable to poor access to healthcare, social services, information, and other supports. This scoping review examined the current literature focused on East Asian American families raising children with autism, with an emphasis on study characteristics and overall findings. We identified nine articles that reported on the caregiving experiences of this population. Our review revealed that extant studies focused on East Asian families used limited research methods and small samples. The studies we reviewed found variations in the ways in which East Asian parents understand autism, navigate services, access available community and family supports, and experience stress.

AB  - The participation of multilingual children in minority language immersion programmes is under-researched internationally. The Republic of Ireland (RoI) has become a linguistically and culturally diverse society. In the RoI, parents have the opportunity to educate their child in English-medium or Irish-medium (IM) schools. However, the cohort of multilingual children attending IM schools is very small. This study investigated the reasons why parents who spoke a home language other than Irish or English chose to enrol their children in IM primary education. It also investigated parents' perceptions of the benefits of this form of education. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 15 parents from a variety of language backgrounds. It was found that parents were motivated to enrol their child in IM primary schools to provide them with the opportunity to learn a variety of languages at an early age. Benefits associated with learning multiple languages and immersion in Irish culture and heritage were seen as the main advantages of IM education. A minority of parents chose an IM school when there was no space for their child in an English-medium school. Parents reported that they did not experience significant challenges in IM immersion. Recommendations arise to support the participation of multilingual families in immersion education.

AB  - Kinship care is care provided by members of a child's extended family or friend network when they can no longer live with their parents. Kinship care is the most prevalent form of out-of-home care, both internationally and in the UK. Little is known about kinship care from the perspectives of children and specifically, the risk and protective factors which may be at play. To explore this gap, this systematic literature review appraised and synthesised qualitative research that gives voice to children's experiences of kinship care. Twenty eligible studies were assessed for quality and relevance. A thematic synthesis of the studies' findings was undertaken, and themes suggesting risk and protective factors for children in kinship care were generated. The theorised risk and protective factors for children in kinship care are presented. Implications of the findings for educational psychology (EP) practice are discussed and the need for further research identified.

AB  - According to the systems perspective, the influence of various systems (e.g., family, school, community) on children's behavior at school is highly acknowledged. It is therefore accepted that problem behavior in the classroom originates from social interactions, providing a conceptual framework where problems are seen as indicative of dysfunction within the school system, thus removing blame from the individual child, the teacher, or the parents. Addressing the importance of interactions among students, teachers, and parents in this system, the present study aimed to identify and compare the types of behaviors that Greek primary and secondary teachers and parents view as problematic in the classroom. A sample of 378 teachers and 69 parents were asked to identify which behaviors were considered troublesome. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five categories of behaviors perceived as problematic by parents and teachers: Externalizing behaviors, School Difficulties, Internalizing behaviors, Attention seeking behaviors, and Hyperactivity/attention difficulties. Both teachers and parents considered externalizing behaviors to be more troublesome than other types of behavior. Teachers tend to worry less than parents about all types of children's behaviors, except for school difficulties. The findings highlight the importance of considering diverse perspectives within the school system when designing interventions to address the specific needs of school communities while also promoting collaboration among all members of the school system.

AB  - Despite increased diagnostic prevalence, Black parents raising autistic youth still experience additional and unique barriers to accessing and using autism-related services compared to their non-Black peers. Increasing parent advocacy capacity may be one way to reduce these disparities. This efficacy study examined the effects of the FACES advocacy program on advocacy capacity for Black parents raising autistic youth. Authors used a quasi-experimental research design that compared pretest and posttest measures for 16 Black parents raising autistic youth. Intervention participants demonstrated increases in family empowerment, school communication, and perceptions of advocacy ability. Findings offer emergent evidence of advocacy programs for Black families raising autistic youth.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the association between Chinese preschool children's home numeracy experiences and their mathematical abilities. The parents of 515 4- to 5-year-old preschool children reported their frequency of participation in home numeracy activities, and the children were assessed on their math ability. The results revealed that the parents engaged in both formal and informal math activities at home. Family socioeconomic status showed significant positive correlations with number game and number application activities. Parental involvement in number skills activities positively predicted young children's formal and informal math ability, while number application activities positively predicted young children's informal math ability. These results suggest that parents should pay attention to both formal and informal activities in support of their children's math learning at home.

AB  - This paper systematically reviews the literature on the causes of leaving school early in Africa and Asia. Despite the improvement in primary school enrolment in the developing countries by 2015, the persistence of school dropout, however, renders this improvement almost insignificant. This leads to the necessity of observing the prolonged determinants of dropping out from school amid the current global development efforts to improve educational attainment in these countries. For this purpose, we review 43 articles in this study. These articles are peer-reviewed publications on the causes of early school leaving or school dropout in Africa and Asia, from the year 2001 to present (2018). A great number of causes are found to be linked to the reason for leaving school early. However, the most common causes for early school leaving include lack of income, parents' education and employment status, living in a single-parent household, being a illegitimate child, age, region of residence and school performance. Specifically, for Asia, immigration and ethnicity are important factors. This paper recommends that policies to prevent early school leaving require multi-perspective targeting, involving individual, school, community and family. For instance, attention needs to be drawn to the effective trickling down of necessary school provisions and other contemporary societal provisions to all communities. There is also need for improved individual and family awareness on the positive impact of education as well as the dangers of certain cultural beliefs.

AB  - A scoping review of studies carried out in the UK and the USA was conducted to explore the perceptions, experiences, and needs of culturally and linguistically diverse families of children with autism. Overall, 32 articles met the inclusion criteria, 25 studies were conducted in the USA and 7 studies in the UK. Four themes emerged including (a) knowledge and beliefs about autism and their impact on the family; (b) autism and family life; (c) family experiences of accessing services and support, and parents' needs; and (d) multilanguage. Findings highlighted that family perceptions of autism are influenced by an often-reported lack of knowledge; experiences include social stigma as well as difficulties in having access to services. Needs indicate the development of culturally sensitive interventions, information in multiple languages, and parent-professional collaboration. Implications for research, policy, and practice are included.

AB  - The aim of this study was to use sociocultural perspectives to elaborate on Eccles' parent socialization model and create a culturally grounded, multidimensional model of parent support among Mexican-descent families. Given Latinx underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers, we focus on science as an important domain in which to study parent support. Using a qualitative approach, this study examines (a) what forms of parent science support do Mexican-descent parents and adolescents perceive as best practices and (b) what are the social, cultural, and contextual barriers parents face and in what ways do parents continue to support their adolescents in science in spite of those barriers? Seventy-four parent (mean age: 40 years; 23% U.S.-born and 77% Mexico-born) and 73 adolescent (mean age: 15 years; 41% female) nterviews were analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches. Findings suggest that parents use traditional and nontraditional culturally grounded forms of support: involvement at home, providing words of encouragement (e.g., "échale ganas"), and leveraging resources (e.g., kin support). Participants felt work-related barriers, linguistic barriers, and limited science knowledge shaped parents' support. Results highlight the unique ways parents support their adolescents' science education as well as the need for educators to consider how parents' sociocultural experiences shape their support.

AB  - Although the evidence of parent training programmes for families of autistic children has continued to grow, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of key stakeholders, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This qualitative study was part of a larger real-world evaluation of a short-term intensive parent training programme in routine services delivered to caregivers of autistic children aged 3--6 years in China. It aimed to provide insights into programme acceptability, reasons for participant involvement, and factors related to programme implementation. Fourteen caregivers participated in the in-depth interviews, and two focus group discussions were conducted with eight practitioners. Data were analysed using a combination of data- and theory-driven approaches. Findings point to the needs in low autism resource settings for substantial practice and feedback; group support; individualised coaching; more autism-related knowledge, resources and activities for children and extended family members; and organisational support to practitioners. Further research is suggested to address the recommendations and assess their effectiveness empirically.

AB  - The United Nation's International Decade for People of African Descent and Nova Scotia's Ministry of African Nova Scotian Affairs recognize that students of African descent continue to experience inequities. As previous studies indicate, parents of Black learners identified that many educators lack knowledge and experience in understanding students of African descent. This study explored student achievement from the perspective of parents of children of African descent attending public schools in Nova Scotia. Participants included individual interviews and focus groups with parents from rural and urban areas. Based on Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory framework, a thematic analysis of the data was conducted, a dominant storyline related to the families' experiences in school and subsequent themes emerged: we are treated differently; we don't feel connected; we know there are challenges: the resistance of parents; and we deal with injustices but persevere. These findings provide recommendations to improve the educational success for Black learners.

AB  - In the field of education and health care, researchers and educators attempt to close the diagnosis/identification and service gaps that persist for low-resourced, underrepresented families with children with autism. One group of families particularly difficult to engage in research and interventions is undocumented immigrant families. We know little about whether these families are obtaining a timely diagnosis or services for their children with autism. This study addresses how undocumented Mexican immigrant mothers of children with autism navigate the special education and health care systems, challenges they face in doing so, and the helpers who assist in navigating the process. Six undocumented Mexican immigrant mothers of children with autism participated in one-on-one interviews. Participants were interviewed in a semi-structured format and transcription, coding, and final analysis were conducted in Spanish using analytic software. Three broad themes emerged during the content analysis process: (1) immigration driving force and experience, (2) autism-specific challenges, and (3) autism-specific helpers. Additionally, a case study of each participant is presented and discussed.

AB  - The popularity of multiplayer online videogames (MOVs) in the lives of young people has become a recurrent area of interest for parents and researchers. The use of these platforms has generated concerns regarding the potential negative effects on children's personal and social development. Additionally, the ways in which players socialize through these games has raised questions concerning what are regarded as the most effective approaches to promote a constructive articulation of virtual and physical worlds. Fortnite, was created by Epic Games in 2017. It can be characterized as a social survival gaming experience and has the most remarkable use on a worldwide scale. The study reported here is a qualitative case study that explores the social dimension of the use of Fortnite and how it impacts on children's and their parents' perceptions regarding its use. A total of 82 in-depth interviews were conducted in 2019 with Argentinian and Chilean children between 9 and 18 years of age and their parents. Findings reveal that parents and children have diverging perspectives regarding the social dimension of the game's immersive experience. The topic developed in this article is of particular relevance to parents and researchers given the current events and widescale use of online platforms due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In English teaching, developing students' reading habits has been emphasized for its critical role in promoting overall core competencies. However, in practice, many teachers and parents are not informed of the effective approaches to developing good English reading habits, hindering the overall development of students' core competencies. In light of this, an empirical study was carried out to explore the developmental features of students' English reading habits and individual, family and school factors that affect its development. A questionnaire was adopted to collect quantitative data. A total of 2,130 primary and secondary school students from China participated in the study. The results indicated that their English reading habits varied with age and gender. In terms of age, secondary school students, especially middle school students, performed better than primary school students. In terms of gender, females performed better in reading frequency, reading time and ways of reading, while males had a larger reading volume. Reading habits were found to be impacted by individual, school and family factors. Among them, age had the strongest influence on the development of English reading habits. These findings shed light on effective ways to develop English reading habits, especially in foreign-language-learning contexts.

AB  - French immersion programs in Saskatchewan have traditionally served to further the goals of additive bilingualism between Canada's two official languages, French and English. Whereas these programs have historically consisted of predominantly Anglophone populations, recent trends in immigration have contributed to the increasingly diverse linguistic backgrounds of students throughout the province. The motivation, family support, and high academic achievement of allophone students learning French as an additional language have been documented extensively in Canada (Dagenais & Jacquet, 2000; Mady, 2013, 2014, 2015). Nevertheless, allophone students often do not benefit from the same access to second language education programs as their Anglophone and Francophone peers; indeed, such learners are sometimes excluded from French immersion programs on the basis of their lack of English language proficiency (Roy, 2015). Through Likert-scale surveys and semi-structured interviews, this mixed-methods research explored the perceived suitability of French immersion for allophone students by examining the perspectives of parents and educators in several schools in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This study will share the triangulated findings of the research, discuss the suitability of French immersion programs for allophone students, and provide recommendations for the future of such programs in Saskatchewan.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions of preschool teachers and parents about their cooperation and to examine whether there are differences in the perception of this cooperation regarding the status of the respondents' children (children of typical development and children with developmental disabilities). The assessment of cooperation was conducted by using the Family Involvement Questionnaire -- FIQ (Fantuzzo, Tighe, & Childs, 2000), adapted for the purposes of this study. The results show that there is a statistically significant difference between the perceptions of preschool teachers and parents regarding parental involvement in preschool activities (Z=-5.614; p<0.01). Parents consider that they participate in preschool activities to a higher extent than perceived by preschool teachers. There is a statistically significant difference in the perception of preschool teachers regarding their cooperation with parents of children of typical development and with parents of children with developmental disorders (Z=-2.38; p<0.05), whereby preschool teachers notice that they have a better cooperation with parents of children of typical development. It can be concluded that there is a need for planning guidelines and implementing practical procedures that would contribute to better cooperation between preschool institutions and parents of children with developmental disabilities.

AB  - This is a qualitative inquiry looking into the experiences of parental involvement in the context of Philippine public elementary education. This paper has two goals. First, it aims to present the strategies that Filipino parents employ in order to influence children's education. Second, it aims to examine unique involvement strategies among Filipino parents. Data of this paper were culled from 12 focus group discussions conducted in 5 provinces of the country. The results of the study suggest that there are parental involvement strategies unique to the Philippine context owing to the poor economic conditions of some Filipino families. While it is not directly related to education, making ends meet and providing food for the family's table were seen as parental involvement strategies. To compensate for the limited direct involvement in education, Filipino parents looked for other means to be able to help their children excel such as exempting the latter from doing household chores, avoiding vices, and maintaining quality family relationships. It against this backdrop that this paper recommends that future quantitative studies on parental involvement in the Filipino parents' context need to consider indirect parental involvement strategies as indicators or variables as these may have spillover impacts on children's schooling.

AB  - This paper approaches addressing the linguistic needs of Iraqi refugee students living in Turkey. Turkey is trying to find solutions to this language and social barrier. Having a command of Turkish and English will allow them to feel more self-confident, more easily establish communication with their peers, receive better education, have broader employment opportunities, and eventually earn better income. The aim of this paper is to show what benefits the foreign language training we provide has on institutions, communities, and individuals, in order to accelerate guest students' adaptation into the society within which they are living, as well as into education. The core of this research is comprised of eighty-three Iraqi refugee students receiving education at a middle, as well as high school, in the province of Ordu. The students' educational progression was evaluated through classroom observation, interviews, e-mails, telephone conversations, face-to-face discussions, family visits, and casual talks with parents, children, youth, and teachers, and then defined as a sample group. This paper is also expected to serve as a reference guide for language training programs in multicultural environments as is based on the results obtained from our research and experience. Language will help remove the distance between them and society, enable healthy dialogue, and speed up their process of social integration.

AB  - Families play a critical role in fostering talent development, and need guidance and support with parenting practices. The purposes of this study were to describe a psychoeducational program for parents of gifted children and to investigate the participants' perceptions of the program. Nine Brazilian families participated. The data was collected through three questionnaires to which participants were asked to respond at different moments of the program. The program was implemented over 12 fortnightly group meetings of 2 h 30 min each. Parents considered their participation in the program as (a) an opportunity for exchanging experiences; (b) gaining knowledge, including self-knowledge; (c) and developing a feeling of belonging and identity. The study revealed the importance of providing support and guidance groups for parents of gifted children. The findings also provide suggestions about program design and implementation, as well as information that might benefit professionals to help parents overcome challenges and develop successful strategies in raising their gifted child.

AB  - The current qualitative and quantitative study methods intend to investigate the quality of electronic examinations and the obstacles of changing the examinations' process from the participants' experiences and perspectives. The study generates feedback to enhance the adoption and improvement of the e. examination process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic exams help much during the education interruption. The study employed two tools to answer the study's central question: "To what extent did teachers and students reflect on the quality of electronic examinations' criteria?" They Were distributed among (n=165) undergraduates and (n=24) faculty members during 2020/2021. Findings from the e. questionnaire's SPSS and interview's content analyses indicated that most participants were satisfied with the e. exams' flexibility, ease of use, clarity, fairness in grading, and feasibility in time, efforts, and money. Concerning challenges, few undergraduates complained about the Network problems, e. cheating, and the number of attempts to answer e. exams. Few faculty members have complained that some questions require different preparation methods, e. exams increase students' scores without much effort. On the other hand, it opened the door for malpractices. To conclude, the results revealed that e. examinations are of high quality; they were responsible for undergraduates' high performance, saved effort and time more than the in-class exams. The study recommends future research exploring families, especially parents, about their experience with kids regarding the quality of online examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, research is needed to address how teachers deal with the validity and reliability of the electronic exams.

AB  - Bilingual parents must often make difficult and complex choices about which languages to use with their children. While existing research has explored family language practices and attitudes within certain language communities, the experiences of African parents are conspicuously absent from the literature. This study explores factors influencing intergenerational language transmission among African families in the UK. As educators can influence parental language choices, data were collected through semi-structured interviews with Early Years Professionals and parents of children attending nurseries. Interviews considered participants' language backgrounds, attitudes and practices, especially in relation to heritage language maintenance. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that being proficient in the English language was prioritised by all participants over maintaining the children's heritage language, and the value of African languages was low. The findings suggest that the educators' language practices were influenced by the monolingual education system and, for parents, colonial language ideologies that place English on a pedestal over African languages continue to play an influential role in shaping their language attitudes. Implications of this study include the need for increased understanding within Early Years practice of the unique language profiles and practices of bilingual African families.

AB  - This article draws on qualitative evidence from an evaluation of the "Greater Tomorrow" Crèche and Ballyhaunis Community Preschool in Ballyhaunis, Co Mayo, Ireland in 2016. The article focuses on the approach to practice and the underlying ethos of these two services, reflecting a clearly articulated respect for diversity and the privileging of relationships with families by the practitioners and management team. We argue for the significance of early years services in offsetting risk factors associated with adverse childhood experiences and environments, reflecting international research evidence for the potential benefits of high-quality early childhood education and care. The practice orientation within the settings operationalises the national quality and curriculum frameworks of Aistear and Síolta in foregrounding the concepts of identity and belonging, well-being, and partnership with families in daily practice. The services under study were established during a period of rapid social and cultural change in Ireland; heightened economic activity beginning in the mid-1990s was a catalyst for increasing female employment and inward migration. This article argues that in such a context, these services responded to the needs of the uniquely diverse community they serve, contributed to children's early learning and development, and provided material and emotional supports to children and parents.

AB  - Family-school partnerships have been shown to improve academic and social outcomes for children, yet there have been challenges in developing effective partnerships with diverse families. This phenomenological study examined perspectives of immigrant and local parents with regards to family-school partnerships in Hawai?i to provide insights regarding these challenges in this unique context. Results demonstrated that parents valued the relational aspect of family-school partnerships and believed that education for their children was important. Beyond supporting children's learning, participants wanted to understand their children's experiences in school and to participate in building a school community. They identified the importance of the principal's role in affording effective partnerships and discussed cultural mismatches with educators that created barriers for their participation. This study adds to the literature by examining parent perspectives in the context of the complexity of family, school, and community attributes in Hawai?i, including the voices of diverse families that reflect the increasing diversity of schools.

AB  - Purpose: The research adopting children's perspectives about early care and education has flourished since the adoption of UNCRC; however, the studies investigating experiences of children from diverse backgrounds in the literature are still scarce. This study aims to describe disadvantaged children's experiences in a target preschool from their own perspectives. Research Methods: This study is part of a large-scale research project, and it focuses on disadvantaged children's perspectives using a case study design. The case of interest included a specific group of people associated with a unique preschool designed for the disadvantaged children. The data comes from 26 children and their parents for this study. Child interviews were the primary source of data. Parent interviews, observations and other documents supplemented data analysis. The data was analyzed using ATLAS.ti 7 Software. Findings: The basic dimensions of schooling experiences included children's attitudes toward school, engagement in daily activities, and echoes of school experiences at home. The findings suggest that access to resources does not mean quality educational experiences for all children, and there is room for improvement. Although disadvantaged children appeared to have positive attitudes toward school, their experiences involved limited engagement in certain activities. All children had inadequate stimulation and low-quality interactions with the parents at home regarding the school experiences. Comparing experiences based on gender, age, developmental milestones and family structure yielded some differences in children's experiences of schooling. Implications for Research and Practice: This study highlights the need for inclusive and enriched educational practices for disadvantaged children. Future research may investigate children's educational experiences in mixed schools and examine home-school connections.

AB  - Parental involvement is well-documented in the literature. Although research suggests a strong positive association between parental involvement and children's educational outcomes, few studies have examined parental involvement at home with children who attend charter schools, especially with small immigrant groups such as the Hmong. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how Hmong parents of students in charter schools were involved in their children's education at home and what barriers they faced. This study included 23 Hmong parents (9 fathers, 15 mothers) of elementary school-aged children enrolled in three Hmong-focused charter schools in Minnesota. The results showed several themes related to barriers for at-home school involvement, including work schedules, literacy barriers, lack of spousal support, and multiple children at home. Despite these barriers, Hmong parents also indicated that they sacrificed for their children's education by taking on multiple jobs, created and maintained regular family routines to monitor children's education, and connected children to appropriate resources for homework help, including older siblings. Implications for school administrators and teachers who work with Hmong parents, especially Hmong parents who have children enrolled in charter schools, are also discussed.

AB  - Students with sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) are at increased risk for learning disabilities and often require individualized supports in the school setting. Parents of students with rare disorders such as SCAs possess a unique understanding of their child's educational experiences and play a crucial role in the development of successful school support plans. This international survey study aimed to inductively capture parent perspectives on educational needs and supports for students with SCAs. Parents of youth with SCAs ages 5-21 years (n = 305) provided free-text responses to open-ended questions about their child's education. Qualitative content analysis using a bioecological systems framework resulted in three overarching themes. Overall, parents identified multiple factors related to the SCA diagnosis that act as barriers to learning, a strong need for school-based social and emotional supports, and elusive or incomplete educational support plans. Based on these findings, we recommend developing robust family-school partnerships, increased collaboration between the school and the child's medical team, and acknowledgement of the significant role the genetic condition plays in the educational experiences of students with SCAs. Specific suggestions for school support plans for students with SCAs are explored, such as providing school-based behavioral health supports and explicit teaching of executive function strategies.

AB  - Parents' conceptions of assessment are important as they have a key role in supporting their child's educational goals. Through two focus group interviews conducted in Spanish, Mayan mothers (N = 8) discussed their experiences acquiring assessment knowledge. The results suggest that the parents held basic conceptions of assessment, and described different assessment experiences for different purposes. The study highlights how parents interact with different stakeholders when reaching out for assessment information, and how they balance the needs of their child, family, and community. The overall implications can help parents ask assessment questions, become more knowledgeable in the educational process, and inform teacher education programs on how to talk to parents.

AB  - Objective: Modifying the unhealthy dietary habits of children in low- and middle-income countries is important to overcome the increasing prevalence of childhood under- and overnutrition. Dietary habit formation is multifactorial, with parental influence fundamental in determining children's food environment and intake. Therefore, understanding parents' perspectives regarding healthy eating in their preschool-aged children in low- and middle-income countries is necessary to tailor programmes and interventions. However, limited research exists. This study therefore explored parents' and caregivers' understanding of healthy eating and perceived barriers and strategies to support their preschool children's healthy eating in a middle-income country, Sri Lanka. Design: Qualitative study employing focus group discussions. Setting: Preschools in an urban area of north-western Sri Lanka. Method: Thirteen focus groups, each comprising 6-10 participants, were conducted with 110 parents/caregivers of children aged 2-6 years in Kurunegala (an urban area), in north-west Sri Lanka. Group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated into English, coded and underwent inductive content analysis. Results: Participants' understanding of healthy eating was largely consistent with dietary guidelines. Perceived barriers to healthy eating were predominantly intrapersonal ('pester power' and 'picky eating' of children), and family and peer-related (inadequate family support and peer influence). Suggested strategies included changes in household food availability, preparation and rewards, and creating more supportive environments (family, preschool and community). Conclusion: To optimise nutrition intervention outcomes, strategies targeting the identified intrapersonal, family and peer barriers should be incorporated.

AB  - Background: Since the life expectancy of people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) is increasing, siblings may take over care/support roles from their parents. Method: To explore how parents and siblings of persons with PIMD view siblings' role regarding future care/support for their family member, we interviewed eight parents and 13 siblings of seven persons with PIMD and analysed the data thematically. Results: While some parents expected that a future care/support role would burden the sibling unfairly, most siblings anticipated such a role and reported no concerns about this future responsibility. Despite a lack of explicit communication, expectations of parents and siblings regarding future responsibilities corresponded. However, some siblings mentioned the lack of explicit communication made them feel unprepared for the future. Conclusions: Explicit family communication may make siblings feel more prepared for the future and decrease the discrepancy between parents' and siblings' views regarding an expected future burden.

AB  - Pathological demand avoidance (PDA) is contended to be a distinct presentation within autism characterised by extreme levels of anxiety in response to the demands of everyday life, manifested in excessive levels of demand avoidance. This results in complex interactions with service providers in education and health settings, impacting on outcomes for individuals and their families. This national study sought to gather the viewpoints of individuals who experience PDA, families, and practitioners, with the intention of determining levels of knowledge, recognition and understanding of PDA; exploring current pathways to assessment and diagnosis; capturing experiences of access to education and healthcare services; identifying effective intervention and support strategies; and illuminating education and health outcomes for individuals and families. This mixed-method study collates survey responses from N = 264 parents, N = 9 life partners, N = 6 individuals experiencing PDA and N = 54 practitioners, and in-depth individual and focus group interviews from these cohorts. Findings suggest that a flexible, informed and individualised approach to assessment and service provision for individuals presenting with a PDA profile is essential. Practitioners universally referred to the necessity for a streamlined, integrated and multi-disciplinary approach. The reported disconnect between education and health systems indicates a need for access to services on an equitable basis.

AB  - The road to employment begins in high school. However, few youth with severe disabilities currently participate in paid employment before graduation. The purpose of this study was to map the breadth of barriers that can hinder youth from accessing this influential transition experience. We held individual (n = 8) and focus group (n = 16) interviews with 74 transition stakeholders, including parents, educators, adult agency staff, school district leaders, and local employers. Collectively, they identified 47 barriers falling within eight broad categories of challenges: school, student, family, workplace, service system, partnership, transportation, and community. Although there were areas of clear consensus, noticeable differences were evident in the concerns raised by each of these five stakeholder groups. We present recommendations for research and practice aimed at connecting more youth with severe disabilities to early work experiences that can change their post-school employment trajectories.

AB  - In this article, we focus on how Pacific family support places success of individuals within a wider narrative of intergenerational family stories, contributing to successful futures for the participating Pacific youth and their families. Guided by Pacific research principles, we used interviews with families and adolescents to explore the role of family narratives, in ten Pacific families in Aotearoa New Zealand, which supported academic success for their children. Our data sources included conversations with youth, their families, and visual representations created by the youth to illustrate their perceptions of parental support. The findings highlighted the role of families' stories in supporting their children's education. Strong intergenerational expectations were expressed from the dual perspectives of parents and their children. The formative role of family stories within the youths' experiences of success provides opportunity to acknowledge the relational foundations of intergenerational stories.

AB  - Background: For students with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges they were already experiencing at school. Methods: This qualitative study employed focus groups and interviews with students, parents, school, and medical personnel to explore the school experiences of students with TBI. Thematic qualitative analyses were used. Results: Key themes from the analysis include (a) incidence of brain injuries decreased; (b) screen time for students with TBI exacerbated symptoms; (c) COVID protocols at school made it difficult for educators to identify and provide accommodations for students with TBI; (d) COVID protocols at school could inadvertently exacerbate mental health difficulties after a TBI; and (e) COVID-related logistics increased the time between an injury and return to school or return to play. Implications for School Health Policy, Practice, and Equity: The results from this study suggest that professional development for teachers supporting students with TBI is needed, especially for online learning environments. Additionally, because mental/behavioral health concerns may arise for students with TBI in online learning environments, school health care providers can work with families to assess a student's mental health, making referrals to appropriate supports. Conclusions: There is a significant need for professional development and school-wide infrastructure supportive of students with TBI.

AB  - Purpose: This study explores the community-building practices of a school leader at a middle/high school in a Latino/a and African American community. I analyze how the principal leveraged his immigrant identity and experiences to connect with immigrant families and adapt to their needs to form a sense of belonging in the school and neighborhood. I focus on the power of immigrant and BIPOC school leaders drawing from their cultural practices to lead efforts for family engagement. Methods: My study draws on a 3-year critical ethnographic study. Qualitative data sources include participant observation of school/community events; interviews with school faculty, parents, and community members; and participatory methods. I draw on the concepts of "pedagogies of acompañamiento" and "critical care" to theorize practices that educators employ to forge relationships with families and create humanizing spaces. Findings: I argue that the school's principal, a Latino immigrant, functioned as a "border broker" in helping families find a sense of belonging in the school and community. He embodied "pedagogies of acompañamiento" as he accompanied parents through marginalizing experiences and created spaces where they could share and participate in decision-making. Discussion: I highlight the possibilities of "pedagogies of acompañamiento" in school spaces and recommend practices for school leaders in designing engagement strategies.

AB  - Participants in longitudinal studies that followed children into adulthood now have children of their own, which has enabled researchers to establish multiple-generation cohorts. In this article, I illustrate the benefits of multiple-generation cohort studies for developmental researchers, including: (a) the impact of child and adolescent characteristics (i.e., preconception factors) on parenthood can be studied from a developmental perspective and without having to rely on retrospective reports, (b) intergenerational continuity and transmission can be examined for psychological, behavioral, and social development, and by comparing parent and offspring generations for the same developmental period, and (c) the interplay of genetic and environmental influences on parenting and child development can be disentangled. Even though multiple-generation studies pose unique logistical and methodological challenges, such cohorts are indispensable for rigorous research into parenting and the origins of child development.

AB  - Over the past few decades, there has been a shift from the traditional family structure, with more acceptance of different structures, including those led by single parents. This qualitative photo-narrative study aimed at making the voices of single mothers raising children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) heard. According to the literature, parenting a child with a disability can be very stressful on several different levels. Seven single mothers living in southern Israel and parenting children with ASD told their life stories and took photographs depicting their motherhood experience. The data underwent thematic content analysis. The main themes that emerged were the shattering of the family dream, the mothers and the educational setting, the present in the shadow of the future, single parents' support resources and the mothers' search for meaning. The data demonstrated that the mothers' daily life was rife with challenges. Providing assistance and support during different stages, including diagnosis, educational transitions and daily struggles, as outlined in the Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement, was crucial. The mothers also stressed that they drew strength from their love for their child and their existing support systems.

AB  - Purpose: Understanding students' home literacy environments can help speech-language pathologists, teachers, and other educators partner with families to promote language and literacy learning. This study focused on gaining insight into the views of parents of elementary-age students with intellectual and developmental disabilities who had complex communication needs related to supporting children's language and literacy learning in the home. Method: This qualitative study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many schools were utilizing remote or hybrid learning arrangements. Participants were 37 parents of students with complex communication needs in kindergarten to fourth grade. Most children had either autism or Down syndrome, and they ranged from primarily communicating prelinguistically (e.g., gestures and nonword vocalizations) to using some two to three word phrases in different modes (e.g., speech, sign, and aided augmentative and alternative communication [AAC]). Each parent was interviewed three times over the 2020-2021 school year, and data were analyzed using an inductive qualitative approach. Results: Findings showed patterns of commonalities and differences in parents' experiences, including related to their (a) goals and values about communication, language, and literacy; (b) perceptions and experiences with roles supporting language and literacy; and (c) satisfaction with supports and progress in these areas. Conclusion: This study provides important insight into the views of parents related to home literacy that can be used to improve the design and delivery of interventions for school-age students with complex communication needs and their families.

AB  - This study was undertaken to examine how parental literacy experiences were reflected in the literacy tendencies and experiences of preservice teachers. It is known that in order to offer an effective teacher education, it is necessary to know preservice teachers by analyzing their literacy practices originating from their parents and take into account their tendencies about how to develop reading skills of primary school children. The research presented here was a phenomenological study implemented with six senior preservice teachers of elementary education and their parents. The data of the study were collected through interviews with the preservice teachers and their parents and through observation notes. According to the results of the study, the preservice teachers' literacy experiences reflected their parents' characteristics, including parental literacy perceptions, literacy approaches developed by the parents for the preservice teachers, personal literacy experiences, general past experiences, number of literate people in the family, parental professional experiences, parental worldviews, and verbal communication within the family.

AB  - Family engagement is considered to be a cornerstone of successful universal prekindergarten (PreK) implementation. Using data from interviews with mothers, this study investigates the different ways families are engaged in their child's PreK experience. Multiple themes emerged from the interviews, including: family engagement, parents' knowledge about what their child is learning, learning through play, and parental goals for their PreK children (e.g., reading, writing, counting). Findings revealed mothers' understandings and definitions of "family engagement" varied. Some mothers considered taking their children to school as a form of family engagement, while others believed actively being in their children's classroom and helping the teacher was parental involvement. Still others defined it as spending quality time with their children at home. Mothers who were not engaged in these activities described different barriers contributing to the lack of engagement. The aim of this study is to help school leaders and teachers develop better understandings of family members' perspectives and experiences around family engagement. The goal of this work is to foster reciprocal partnerships between teachers, school personnel, and family members to increase the potential for families to feel included in their children's early educational experiences.

AB  - The University-Model school incorporates private school and homeschool methods within a Christian school experience. Parents receive the title of "co-instructors" as they partner with teachers in educating their child. This phenomenological study explored the elements that influenced parents' choice when selecting a school. Simon's 1955 satisficing theoretical lens was used to explore parents' satisfaction with their school choice. Two focus groups were held with six University-Model school parents, and six common themes were established as factors sought by parents when choosing a school model for their child: 1) more time desired as a family, 2) individualized services for the child, 3) smaller class sizes, 4) full faith-based school experience with extracurricular activities, 5) self-regulation skills for the child, and 6) the experience of education at home.

AB  - Students' informal science learning experiences are believed to strongly influence their attitudes toward science and their abilities in the subject. Factors associated with students' informal science learning experiences include family socioeconomic status and perceived family support. However, little is known about whether perceived family support for children's formal and informal science learning differs significantly. The present study filled this gap by exploring how students' perceived family support for formal/ informal science learning affected the link between their socioeconomic status and their experiences of informal science learning. Survey data were collected from 486 Chinese grade 4-6 primary school students. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that the students' socioeconomic status and their informal science learning experiences were significantly and positively correlated. This association was chain-mediated through two categories of perceived family support. Specifically, students' socioeconomic status affected their informal science learning experiences through the separate mediating role of family support for formal science learning and the sequential mediation of perceived family support for formal and informal science learning. These results uncover the role that family support plays in students' science education; accordingly, parents are encouraged to help their children learn science both formally and informally.

AB  - Background and aims: Children and young people on the autism spectrum frequently report a range of negative educational experiences and face disproportionally high rates of school non-attendance, including school avoidance and permanent exclusion, which can have a significant impact on their well-being as well as educational and broader life outcomes. To date, few studies have examined the full range of proximal (child, parent/family, school levels) and distal (community and society levels) barriers to ensuring the school attendance and the inclusion of autistic pupils. The current study sought to do just that by examining autistic young peoples' school non-attendance and exclusion experiences from the perspectives of multiple informants. Methods: We recruited 12 autistic pupils, who had previously experienced school avoidance and/or exclusion, from one local authority in England, United Kingdom. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the young people themselves, ten of their parents, eight of their current teachers and nine local authority professionals, including six educational psychologists and three specialist autism teachers. We analyzed interviewees' responses using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Interviewees gave overwhelmingly negative accounts of autistic pupils' school non-attendance and exclusion experiences. Our analysis identified a range of school-related factors they felt led to, or exacerbated, negative experiences in their former mainstream schools, and which ultimately led to their or their children's school non-attendance. It also went further to identify distal factors, including fragmented educational experiences, parents "fighting" against a complex bureaucratic system to secure appropriate education for their children, and limited professional involvement. Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the importance of examining the broader context in which autistic pupils are embedded and demonstrate that such pupils are able to successfully attend--and even enjoy--school when they receive the appropriate care and support. Implications: Schools and local authority professionals should seek to work in partnership with parents and autistic pupils to secure the necessary support for their inclusion in mainstream education. Government policy should support the provision of sufficient local authority professionals to adopt a more proactive approach to mitigate autistic pupils' avoidance of and exclusion from school.

AB  - This study aims to explore Turkish young women's family triangulation experiences. The phenomenological research design of the qualitative tradition was utilized. The sample of the study comprised 10 Turkish young women who were selected through convenience sampling. During the data collection, semi-structured interviews were preferred. Data analysis were also conducted via content analysis. Participants reported "insufficient problem/conflict solving ability" of their parents. Holding a parental role, defending the one parent as participants perceive he/she is weak, and feeling caught in the middle were the factors in relation to "mediating pattern." The theme refers to the triangulation pattern that offspring is closer to either of parents than they are to each other. A number of participants described the children and fathers in their own families as "scapegoats" means a pulled out or outsider position in a triangular relationship. "Coalitions" were one of the most frequently reported theme and mainly indicated taking sides or alliances between three (offspring and parents). Triangulated children expressed anger, emotionally distant and disappointment toward their parents as they play a mediating role during the conflicts. Only one participant was able to act without dragging into conflicts and maintained a "balanced position" of triangulation. Moreover, all findings of the current study were briefly discussed in the context of the "value of children" theme as it is the fact that material/economic expectations of parents sharply decrease, and emotional expectations increase from children in Turkish culture.

AB  - Applying a Bourdieusian perspective, we investigate whether families' institutionalized cultural capital (parental education) and economic capital (family income) are associated with the duration of university studies in Finland. We use register data comprising 10,516 students enrolled in universities between 1999 and 2002 and Tobit modeling. The results do not entirely support our hypothesis Institutionalized cultural capital is not associated with students' duration of university studies. However, having higher economic capital decreases the duration of university studies.

AB  - In the United States, families of young children with developmental disabilities may encounter many challenges and obstacles when advocating for their child's developmental services and supports. Research has highlighted that the transition from early intervention services to school-based services is especially confusing and difficult for many families. To limit confusion, the context and procedures of the transition must be clearly understood by all parties involved, including the family, early intervention providers, and school personnel. This exploratory qualitative pilot study highlights different practices used in a transition classroom for young children with developmental disabilities and the experiences of those involved in the transition process. The transition classroom was created through a collaboration between a non-profit early intervention organisation and a public Early Childhood Special Education Program. A teacher, the director of the non-profit organisation, and a parent of a child in the transition classroom were interviewed. Implications emphasising effective partnerships between families, schools, and community organisations, and how to potentially build those partnerships are discussed.

AB  - Surprisingly little research has considered whether parent-child activities facilitate social-emotional development and whether these associations differ for boys and girls. To address this gap, this study leveraged the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (2006-2008) to examine the extent to which story reading, storytelling and music activities longitudinally predicted social-emotional development. Parents reported the frequency of parent-child activities when children (N = 2567) were aged 3-6 and their social-emotional functioning two years later. Multi-group analyses indicated significant sex differences after controlling for family income. Story reading was negatively associated with hyperactivity and emotional/anxiety problems whereas storytelling was negatively associated with physical and indirect aggression among boys, but not girls. Storytelling and music activities were associated with lower hyperactivity among girls. More frequent parent-child activities predicted more prosocial behaviours among both boys and girls. This study highlights that each parent-child activity has its own distinctive implications on social-emotional functioning.

AB  - The field of early intervention is rapidly expanding. Individuals trained in Human Development and Family Science programs are uniquely situated for work in this setting, due to their diverse understanding of human development, from birth through death, and the role of the family system in influencing development. More specifically, individuals from this academic discipline can employ a family systems theory and bioecological theory perspectives to inform their intervention work. The unique insight these theories provide to enhance early intervention work will be discussed and then applied using an actual case study. Though family systems theory and bioecological theory do have limitations in this field, namely their inability to explain a behavioral change and non-linear orientation, the authors feel the benefits of both these theoretical perspectives for explaining family contexts outweigh the limitations.

AB  - Background: About 20-30% of children worldwide report depressive symptoms. This study examined associations between children's depressive symptoms, life events, and family factors. Methods: Nationally representative data (n = 95,725) were drawn from the 2017 School Health Promotion Study in Finland. The respondents were 4th and 5th grade pupils (aged 10-12) in primary schools and their parents/guardians (n = 33,726). Data were analyzed for child-parent dyads (n = 32,181). Associations were studied using cross tabulation and logistic regression models. Results: Children's reports of poor self-rated health, problems with family interactions, and the accumulation of life events were statistically significantly associated with depressive symptoms, also when controlling for sociodemographic factors. Financial situation and parent's depressed mood, both reported by parents, were associated with children's depressive symptoms when both were included in the regression model. However, this association disappeared when other predictors were added to the model. Conclusion: The results make apparent the complex associations between children's depressive symptoms and family factors. Further research is needed on the discrepancies between parent and child experiences.

AB  - Background and aims: Guidelines regarding social cognitive interventions for autistic children suggest incorporating a holistic approach. This includes increasing the family's understanding of difficulties associated with autism, integrations of natural environments, and parents as active agents in the intervention while being supported for their well-being. The current availability of holistic parent-implemented interventions for autistic children is limited, with no qualitative understanding of how parents view the benefits for themselves or their children. Method: The current study expands the literature regarding holistic approaches through a qualitative understanding of parent perceptions of a parent-implemented social communication intervention for autistic children (TalkAbility[TM]), which incorporates a 6-month follow-up. This study sought to gain a deeper understanding from parents on their perceptions of a holistic approach, including the impact on themselves, their families, and their autistic child. Results: Following Braun and Clarke's model of thematic analysis, data was coded into four themes: (a) communication difficulties, frustrations, and progress, (b) social relationships and concerns, (c) communication strategies, and (d) thoughts and emotions surrounding TalkAbility[TM]. Conclusions: Parents report that many components of a holistic approach are instrumental in encouraging social communication in their autistic child. Results highlight the importance of considering parent experiences regarding interventions for their child's social communication skills through a qualitative viewpoint. Implications: Knowing the intervention aspects that parents view as most valuable allows targeted program modifications that reflect actual parent needs. Further understanding regarding the influence of holistic parent-implemented social communication interventions on child communication skills, parenting frustrations, and parent--child relationships is needed.

AB  - Advocating for a child's rights and needs is an experience shared by most families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This qualitative study is an in-depth secondary content analysis of the discourse of 13 immigrant families on their advocacy experience during the early childhood period. Results revealed that, from very early on, parents engage in an adaptive process as advocates to ensure an inclusive future for their children and call on support during key transition periods. In light of these findings, from immigrant families in a Canadian province, implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.

AB  - The demand for preventive and easily implemented interventions to address the needs of children with significant behavioral challenges in general education settings is well-documented. First Step to Success is an evidenced-based program to address challenging behavior in preschool and elementary-school settings with a 20-year history of successful implementation (Walker et al., 1997; Walker et al., 2014b). A revision of the intervention, called First Step Next (Walker et al., 2015), was designed to (1) standardize the program components across preschool and elementary settings; (2) make the program more user friendly for implementers, including parents; and (3) increase the program's efficacy by adding new components and updating existing ones. The current study used a mixed-method approach to compare process data collected from a previous efficacy trial of the original preschool version of First Step (Feil et al., 2014) to the revised version (First Step Next; Feil et al., 2020). Overall procedural fidelity ratings were high for both program variations. Further, alliance and satisfaction ratings, as per parent- and teacher-report, were acceptable, although there were some divergent findings between parent and teacher perspectives at the item level. This study provides support for the feasibility of successfully implementing First Step Next with young children and their families in preschool settings.

AB  - Video is one way to promote, and help families understand, the transition to kindergarten. The present study explored the experiences of parents with transition-to-kindergarten videos. Four videos, in English and Spanish with accompanying information sheets in English and Spanish, targeted parents for transitioning to kindergarten. There were a total of 141 parents in the six classrooms that could have received the videos and information sheets. Findings indicate that the quality of the videos was rated positively and that parents had positive experiences viewing the videos. Parents reported that the videos provided general information about the transition to kindergarten, provided examples of activities they could do to help their child transition to kindergarten, and promoted parents' understanding of child development. Findings are discussed in light of implications for researchers advancing technology tools and family involvement.

AB  - The immigrant population in Hong Kong is steadily increasing every year. This immigrant population largely comprises families, most of whom have pre-school and school-age children. However, limited information is known on the practices that immigrant parents adopt when they become involved in their children's schooling. In the present study, the researcher implemented a Quality Education Fund project called 'Building a caring community: Family support and empowerment.' The project aimed to promote parent education and to build a caring community by implementing a group parent education program (GPEP) for low-income and new immigrant parents. The parent leaders conducted an outreach parent education program in which the low-income, new immigrant parents (target parents) had their children enrolled in two kindergartens. The parent leaders imparted parenting knowledge, shared positive parenting strategies, and exchanged their own experiences with target parents. The present research aims to study how new immigrant parents evaluate their experiences and the effectiveness of the GPEP. Results suggest that providing opportunities for mutual support and emotional healing correlates with improved parenting attitudes and practices.

AB  - Background: Many parents with learning disabilities find themselves locked in a struggle with child protection authorities to retain custody of their children. This struggle is one against deeply entrenched prejudices as well as social arrangements that often deprive parents of needed resources. This in-depth case study explores the contours of such a struggle, and the 'tools' deployed by one couple to keep child protection at bay. The goal is first to give the parents a platform to tell their stories. The second is to help inform the knowledge base of parents, advocates and allied professionals. The third is to consider the impacts the developing disability rights environment is having upon these ongoing struggles. Method: This is a qualitative case study based on interview and document analysis and long-term involvement with a couple with learning disabilities. The material was coded according to the principles of grounded theory. Findings: Three key categories were identified. The first is 'Lessons learned', referring to the knowledge and experience that the parents collected over a lifetime. The second is 'Allies: The family', highlighting the importance of a strong family network. The third is 'Secret weapons', a phrase used by the parents to denote a collection of advocates and professional supporters they strategically surrounded themselves with when needed. Conclusion: This story illustrates the parents' tactical skill and resourcefulness to retain custody of their children. We also document the addition of new tools the parents are able to make use of such as domestic disability and human rights protections that are in turn supported by international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, we also contend that families like theirs live in a state of fragility, and disruptions to their support can result in further child protection interventions.

AB  - This study explored the experiences and perspectives of Latinx mothers of children younger than 3 years who had participated in a developmental screening initiative provided by 2 Federally Qualified Health Centers in an urban setting, had positive developmental screenings, and were referred to early intervention (EI) services. A 2-phase mixed-methods explanatory design was implemented in English and Spanish. In Phase 1, a telephone survey was conducted with 62 parents. In Phase 2, qualitative semistructured interviews (regarding parental experiences with their child's developmental screening, the process of linking to services, the EI evaluation, and subsequent services received) were conducted with a subset of 13 Phase 1 mothers. Results from the phone survey showed that 91% of children were found eligible for EI and 92% were receiving EI services. More than 90% of mothers reported positive experiences with their children's developmental screening, learning about their child's development, and accessing services. However, results from the semistructured interviews revealed that mothers had mixed experiences with the developmental screening process and linkage to EI services. Findings from this study provide insights into the perceived value of EI services by Latinx families and the need for improved system supports to access and navigate EI services.

AB  - One important group of people living a special lifestyle in Mongolia is mobile pastoralists. Requirements from the government of Mongolia push pastoralist parents to send their children to schools in settled areas far from their camps. This interpretative phenomenological study explored primary school classroom teachers' experiences in communicating with pastoralist parents during the school year. In-depth interviews were conducted involving six classroom teachers from a rural primary school in eastern Mongolia. We applied Bronfenbrenner's ecological model to organise our findings in our interpretative phenomenological analysis. The findings indicated that classroom teachers had difficulties in communicating with pastoralist parents. The school and teachers heavily relied on a very few traditional forms of communication which was not appropriate given the pastoralist parents' unique situation. This suggested the need for preparing pre-service teachers better for partnering with pastoralist families and their extended family members, and the need for further professional development on this topic for both teachers and school leaders. Our findings were also related to some contextual factors impacting teacher communication with pastoralist parents besides teacher education. This study highlighted the implications for teacher education and school policy. Potential directions for future research were recommended.

AB  - This study investigated the psychological characteristics of online learning on Italian students with and without hearing loss (HL) and on their parents, who were forced into isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey collected information on socio-demographic data and opinions concerning online learning from 61 children (mean age 11; 25 males, 36 females), including 43 with HL and also from their parents; additionally, school wellbeing and anxiety were assessed. The results showed that, in both the student and parent groups, no significant effect of HL on school wellbeing and anxiety was found. Additionally, in parents, State Anxiety was significantly higher than Trait Anxiety, suggesting one possible impact of lockdown on psychological wellbeing. Differences due to HL were observed and discussed in correlation analyses. The Authors believe that this study is the first contribution to the psychological evaluation of the impact of online learning on families with hearing-impaired children, from the perspective of a successful, inclusive didactic.

AB  - The transition to kindergarten is one of the significant transition steps for children in early childhood. The family, being the closest circle of the child, supports the development of the child in the transition and affects the transition process with its resources and needs. In this regard, this study examined the experiences and participation of families of children with and without special needs in the transition to kindergarten. This study is a survey research in which family experiences and involvement in the transition to kindergarten are determined. The Family Experiences and Involvement in Transition questionnaire was used to assess family involvement in transition preparation activities and transition concerns during kindergarten entry. A total of 232 parents participated in the study. Research results show that both family groups are most concerned with are similar. The research identifies the situation that families are most concerned about as getting used to a new school. Whether they have a child with disabilities or not, the types of information that both family groups prefer were similar. In the transition process, families especially favoured meetings and visits as the types of family involvement. Upon discussing the findings in line with the relevant literature, this study makes suggestions for further research and applications.

AB  - The paper discusses the issue of homework in primary education in Slovakia. It attempts to contribute to uncovering the homework narrative that is created and used by its teaching staff and to relate it to the discourse on homework and its place in education in the Anglo-American environment. The research used content analysis of the written products of 30 participants (teachers, educators in children's school clubs, and teacher's assistants). Data processing and analysis were carried out by thematic analysis. The results, concentrated in four topics, showed that the homework narrative in primary education is based on homework support. It clearly resonates with the teacher's expectation of the involvement of the pupils' parents in its completion. However, it is without the methodical support of the parents from the school. Part of the discourse is also the teachers' prescription taking into account, particularly, the appropriate number of tasks, their attractiveness, an individual approach when assigning them, and the comprehensibility of homework for all persons involved. Such a setting should reflect potential inequalities between pupils concerning their family background. The narrative revealed details the semantics of school-family relations and the pedagogical strategies of teachers in primary education.

AB  - This study extends the research on the preschool "home literacy environment" (HLE) in the context of the family risk (FR) of reading disability (RD) by examining a multiple-deficit model of RD. A total of 1,171 six-year-old Norwegian children were assessed at school entry, the onset of formal reading instruction in Norway. Their parents completed a questionnaire regarding their own RD, education, and the HLE. The final sample after applying the inclusion criteria was 794 children and their parents. The findings suggest, first, that two HLE factors (access to print and reading-related activities) should be distinguished rather than treated as a single factor ("exposure to print") as the majority of previous studies have done. This finding suggests a three-factor HLE model that includes "parents' reading interests and habits, reading-related activities," and "access to print." Second, family risk of RD is related to some extent to the HLE, even after controlling for parents' education. Third, children's experiences in their home environments and their emergent literacy may not be independent of their family risk of RD. More importantly, this study highlights the potential protective role of the HLE, especially when there is a history of RD within the family. The reason is that the positive association between the HLE and children's code-related emergent literacy remains significant when controlling for family risk of RD (access to print [right arrow] emergent literacy: 0.39 [0.01, 0.68], p < 0.01; reading-related activities [right arrow] emergent literacy: 0.37 [0.02, 0.35], p < 0.01; parents' reading interests and habits [right arrow] emergent literacy: 0.26 [0.001, 0.15], p < 0.01). This finding supports that children's emergent literacy can be improved via a modifiable, dynamic factor such as the HLE.

AB  - There have been few attempts to capture the experiences of lesbian-parented families in Australian early childhood settings. This study explored the experiences of such families since the implementation of the first national Early Years Learning Framework in 2009 by way of an online survey and follow-up interviews that were analyzed taking a queer theory approach. Participants shared their perspectives on positive and negative experiences concerning their family structure and offered suggestions for educators working with lesbian-parented families. These insights can inform educators' pedagogical decisions in ways that challenge heteronormativity's dominance in early childhood settings, affirm lesbian-parented families, and foster an understanding of diversity in all children.

AB  - Autism is increasingly viewed as an expression of neurodiversity deserving accommodation, rather than merely as a disorder in need of remediation or even prevention. This reconceptualization has inspired calls to broaden the ethical debate on early autism care beyond matters of efficient screenings and effective interventions. We conducted 14 in-depth interviews with 26 parents of infants at an increased likelihood for autism (siblings, preterms and children with persistent feeding difficulties) to understand which benefits and risks these parents see for the implementation of a systematic, early autism detection program in our region. With this study, we aim to contribute empirically to the ethical debate on good and just early autism care in the age of neurodiversity. Data were analyzed according to the QUAGOL-methodology. Three main themes emerged from our analysis. In their evaluation of early autism detection, parents discussed how a diagnosis helps gain a different perspective fostering understanding and recognition for both child and parent. Second, a diagnosis supports parents in adjusting their parenting practices, to justify this deviation from "normal" parenting and to strive for such adjusted environments beyond the nuclear family. Third, an autism diagnosis induces ambiguities parents need to navigate, involving questions on whether and when to mobilize the diagnostic label and which language to use to talk about autism. We discuss the complex position of parents of a (potentially) autistic child in terms of moving back and forth across the ab/normal binary and describe implications for the ethical debate on early autism detection.

AB  - Taking an interactional sociolinguistic approach, this study explores how multicultural and multilingual siblings interact with their Spanish grandfather and how, through the use of styling and stylization in these interactions, they negotiate and construct multicultural family identities. Using Tannen's power and solidarity framework, I analyze three excerpts from a seven-hour corpus of naturally occurring face-to-face recorded conversations between my sisters, my grandfather, and myself, from 1984 in Spain to explore how speakers use stylization to identify themselves as legitimate members of a multilingual and multicultural family, ranging from acts of identity to mockery. The analyses show that while stylization provided Abuelo with resources for creating harmony with his granddaughters as he reappropriated their Spanish usage, it also created a source for mockery among the sisters. In their conversations with their grandfather, the granddaughters used stylization to perform acts of identity through reported speech about their experiences in Spain and their feelings about their extended family, and this styled them as dutiful granddaughters. Finally, Abuelo styled himself as the authority figure in the house by speaking English to the girls, albeit an English heavily influenced by his Spanish. In response, the granddaughters stylized him, mocking his authority in the process. The study demonstrates how stylization is intimately tied with acts of identity and underscores the affiliative and disaffiliative interactional stances for creating authenticity in a transnational family.

AB  - The current study explored the associations between parenting stress and p\arental self-efficacy on children's social-emotional functioning and home learning practices among Latino families. Families were recruited as part of a pilot study of a parent-focused school readiness intervention that was conducted via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample was comprised of children (M[subscript age] = 3.02 years; 64% male) enrolled in Early Head Start, and their parents (97% biological mothers). At baseline, parents reported on family demography, parenting stress, involvement in home learning activities (i.e., literacy and math), their self-efficacy in managing a range of situations related to raising young children, and children's social-emotional functioning. Study findings indicated that parenting stress was negatively associated with parent's home literacy involvement, but not with home math involvement. Results also indicated that parental self-efficacy moderated the relationship between parenting stress and children's social-emotional functioning, specifically externalizing and internalizing problems. Lastly, results indicated a positive association between parenting stress and children's adaptive skills. Findings from the current study help elucidate our understanding of the psychological well-being of young Latino children and families during COVID-19, and will potentially inform future efforts aimed at supporting Latino parents' well-being and children's early learning experiences during a global health crisis.

AB  - The protective effects of talk with parents about sex in delaying sex and reducing young people's risky sexual behaviour may extend from adolescence to emerging adulthood. However, little is known about the content and process of this communication, or how parents and their emerging adult children perceive their conversations about sex and relationships. This study offers a novel exploration of family talk about sex during emerging adulthood and addresses topics that are not typically assessed as part of communication research, such as consent and positive talk about sexuality. This study uses thematic analysis to investigate perceptions of family talk about sex in a qualitative sample of 16 pairs of parents and their emerging adult children in the USA, and includes talk about protection, sexual behaviour, pregnancy and parenting; the positive aspects of sex; consent; and sexual orientation. Findings identified variation across topics in terms of 1) similarities and differences in parents' and emerging adults' comfort in talking with each other about sexual topics; and 2) how they perceive this communication across a range of sexual issues. Findings can inform the development of resources to support parents on how to talk with their emerging adult children about sexual issues in a developmentally appropriate way.

AB  - This qualitative study explored the experiences of Korean American (KA) immigrant parents of children with development disabilities (DDs) for their children with DDs living in the southeastern U.S. Using the Contextual Model of Family Stress as an organizing theoretical framework, we examined differences based on cultural characteristics, parents' gender, child's age, and diagnosis. Twenty KA parents of children with DDs participated in the study. We used grounded theory methods to analyze the data. Four major themes emerged including source of difficulties, source of support, perceptions of developmental progress, and personal transformations. The results indicated that KA parents shared similar experiences, but they varied depending on internal and external factors. Despite higher risk of stress, participants reported reframing challenges positively and using different types of support. However, parents who recently immigrated, lacked spousal support, and had children with severe symptoms appeared more vulnerable. We discuss implications for professionals working with this population.

AB  - This qualitative study was designed to explore diverse-family parents' perspectives of their communication with their children's teachers. Semi-structured in-depth non-directive interviews were conducted to gather the participants' descriptions of their experience communicating with the teachers. Findings reveal that teachers tend to avoid classroom discussion of issues related to diverse-family patterns, and are not sufficiently sensitive to children from such families. The parents maintain that teachers should receive formal training to address such issues in class, while acknowledging their own responsibility to explain themselves to the teachers. Study limitations are listed and future research possibilities are suggested.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine parents' perspectives and experiences of special education, including the degree to which decisions about their child's education were implemented as they had agreed upon with the school personnel. Additionally, a secondary purpose of this study was to understand how parents explain why school personnel do or do not implement elements of their child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). In this study, parents of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities described their experiences attempting to reach agreement with school personnel on decisions involving their child's educational placement and special education services. Parents expressed a desire to be involved in decisions, and they described a desire to obtain inclusive educational placements for their children. Parents described varied experiences with the implementation of special education services. They also described both successes and concerns related to the special education services their child was receiving at school. Implications for special education policy, practice, and research are discussed from the perspective of supporting family involvement in the special education process.

AB  - This pilot study integrated quantitative and qualitative data to examine the feasibility of implementing a modified version of a multiple family group behavioral parent training intervention (The 4Rs and 2Ss for Strengthening Families Program [4Rs and 2Ss]) in child welfare (CW) placement prevention services from the perspectives of participating caregivers (n = 12) and CW staff (n = 12; i.e., 6 caseworkers, 4 supervisors, and 2 administrators). Quantitative surveys were administered to caregivers and CW staff followed by semi-structured interviews to examine the feasibility of implementing the modified 4Rs and 2Ss program as well as factors impacting feasibility. Results indicated that quantitative benchmarks for high feasibility were met in all assessed areas (e.g., family recruitment, caseworker fidelity ratings, CW staff feasibility ratings) except for family attendance, which was markedly lower than desired. Factors facilitating feasibility included agency and research support, intervention ease-of-use, perceived benefits to existing CW practice, and logistical support (e.g., food, transportation, child care) promoting attendance. Factors hindering feasibility included conflicts between research-based eligibility criteria and existing client population demographics, research-related processes resulting in delays, CW staff role conflicts, added workload burden, complex family issues, and power differentials inherent to CW services which complicated families' voluntary participation.

AB  - Many adult workers struggle to balance family and work roles, potentially leading to inter-role conflict. Similarly, adult students experience conflicting demands of academic and family roles. The study explored the prevalence and correlates of family and academic role conflict using a sample of 300 students selected from five faculties of the University of Nigeria. Data were collected with a questionnaire titled Family and Academic Role Conflict Scale. The questionnaire was validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. A bi-factor model was established; the academic-to-family role (AFR) conflict, the family-to-academic role (FAR) conflict factors, and the combined family and academic role conflict (FARC). Data were analysed using frequencies, percentages, point biserial correlation, and multiple regression. Results showed a high (23.3%) prevalence of FARC with a higher prevalence (38.0%) of the AFR than the 19% prevalence of the FAR conflict. Certain demographic characteristics of the students such as age, marital status, and parents/guardians/spouses' educational status significantly correlate with family and academic role conflict. The study concludes that undergraduate students experience inter-role conflict between their family and academic roles in the same way as employed adults experience work and family conflict and this could impact their academic performance and overall well-being. University authorities need to fully understand family and academic role conflict among students to develop sustainable solutions. This article provides insights into how such conflict plays out in this particular context. Therefore, collaboration among stakeholders is crucial for effective strategies to balance family demands and the academic responsibilities of students.

AB  - Values education has become a necessary tool in response to the rise in moral deterioration in an average South African society today. The school is viewed as one of the key players in nurturing children into adulthood. The teaching of values that can give the growing generation, necessary moral development is one of the responsibilities of the schools. Hence, this study aims at exploring teachers' experiences on how they integrate values education into South African learners in various high schools. This qualitative study engaged five schools in its case study, where five teachers from each of the schools were purposively selected for semi-structured focus group interviews, to share their experiences on the integration of moral values in schools. Moral development theory was used to underpin the study. Findings from the inductive thematic analysis from the participants from both rural and urban schools indicated a misunderstanding of the concept of values education by some teachers, which affects its effective integration. The study established that role modelling of learners by teachers and parents are inevitable to save the society from moral decadence, while some participants indicted overpopulation, single parenthood, social media as some of the challenges to the integration of value education in schools. The study, therefore, recommends capacitation of teachers through various professional development programmes, to integrate values education and adequate parental support as some of the strategies to promote effective integration of values education in schools.

AB  - Knowledge of how parenthood is experienced by autistic women is currently poor. Nine autistic mothers to children aged 5-15 years completed semi-structured interviews, analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. All mothers considered at least one of their children to also be autistic. Four superordinate themes emerged: 1. "Autism fundamentally impacts parenting"; 2. "Battle for the right support"; 3. "Development and acceptance"; and 4. "The ups and downs of parenting." The themes demonstrate that while motherhood is largely a joyful experience for autistic mothers (Themes 1 and 4), it is associated with specific issues unlikely to be found in neurotypical motherhood (Theme 1), including negotiating misunderstandings from others (Theme 2). The need for self-care and self-acceptance was expressed (Theme 3) with parenting resulting in personal growth and adaptation (Theme 3). Feelings of intense connection and closeness were experienced (Theme 4), though managing children's needs had a profound personal impact (Themes 2 and 4). The findings demonstrate that service-providers would benefit from training, ideally led by autistic individuals, on how autism presents in adulthood, masking, the potential for mismatching between emotional experience and facial expression, sensory needs (especially in pregnancy), and the double empathy problem (Theme 2). This study represents the first systematic in-depth analysis of the experiences of autistic mothers presented from their own perspectives.

AB  - Undocumented students face significant barriers in accessing postsecondary education. Previous research has focused on how individuals and schools impacted their experiences of enrolling in college. This critical qualitative study of "testimonios" with 15 undocumented Latina/o students examines how their families shaped and supported their college navigation process. Using a funds of knowledge framework, we find that parents and siblings shaped undocumented students' college choices through "dichos", or culturally situated advice. Once students attended college, many expressed a desire to give back to their parents and inspire other family members to pursue college. Students also articulated the utility of their degree as an avenue to give back to their local communities. We discuss the need for institutions to honor the collectivist orientation of Latina/o/x students and their families through recruitment and engagement efforts with these students.

AB  - Trilingual education policy is fomenting much debate among scholars and public intellectuals in Kazakhstan. However, parents' ideologies in relation to trilingual education are not heard although their participation in policy discussions is important since they play a key role in their children's education. Therefore, this article, through the lens of an adapted language ideology framework, Curdt-Christiansen [2009, Invisible and visible language planning: Ideological factors in the family language policy of Chinese immigrant families in Quebec. "Language Policy," 8(4), 351-375. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10993-009-9146-7 ] examines the influence of political, economic, cultural and social, and educational factors on parents' language ideologies and ideological differences depending on the geographical location and type of school. The qualitative findings reported in this article stem from a larger mixed methods research study within which 24 interviews were conducted with parents from trilingual and mainstream schools in the North, Centre and South of Kazakhstan. The findings indicate that although the majority of parents support trilingual education policy from the political, economic and cultural perspectives, they believe that teaching in English, Kazakh and Russian should be introduced gradually to avoid negative outcomes. Studying content subjects in three languages is seen as problematic since not all children possess giftedness and abilities that are purportedly important for successful studying. Neglecting this might lead to illiterate school graduates.

AB  - The Division for Early Childhood (DEC) clearly outlined recommended practices for the provision of Part C services. However, there may be challenges in rural areas associated with services aligning with these recommended practices. Therefore, this study focuses on how families experience Part C services and the extent to which services align with specific areas the DEC recommended practices in the large, rural state of Montana. We interviewed parents (N = 30) about their children's Part C services. Deductive qualitative content analysis was used. Parents' reports suggest that while some aspects of their Part C services align with specific recommended practices, others do not. There were some meaningful differences regarding alignment with these recommended practices depending on type of provider being described. The environments in which services take place are discussed, as these may influence aspects of collaboration and building family capacity.

AB  - Families with children on the autism spectrum are often viewed in terms of their deficits rather than their strengths. Family meals are portrayed as sources of stress and struggle for parents and children. In this study, we take a resilience perspective to challenge underlying assumptions and get a more accurate picture of the nature of shared family meals. In-depth interviews were conducted and mealtimes were video recorded with 16 families for this thematic analysis. We identified four themes as being particularly salient to the mealtime experience: (1) schools and homework, (2) managing eating, (3) chores, and (4) intimate conversations. Our results elucidate the context of mealtimes as a site where parents struggle, yet negotiate, the challenges of everyday family life.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand the story underlying the preference of parents (mothers-fathers) for home school in Turkey and to determine the main points in this story. For this purpose, this study was conducted according to the narrative study model, one of the qualitative research designs. Within the context of this study, the opinions of mothers and fathers of three children receiving their education in the same home school during their preschool period were elicited. As a result of the analysis of the interviews conducted within the context of this study, three super themes and seven different codes gathered under these themes were obtained. As a conclusion, the reasons for the parents' choice of home school instead of a formal education institution were found to be "Inconsistency between the parents' expectations and what is offered by the education system, negative effects of formal education on the child, family ideal, school experiences, educational philosophy and employment status, developmental reasons/concerns, negative social interaction at school, and their encounter with the proposal for home school."

AB  - Family involvement has become increasingly recognized as essential to academic success. However, the racial and cultural gap between the teaching force and students in American schools is large and expanding, leading to increased challenges associated with relationship-building between families and schools. This is a study of teachers in a school district in the State of Florida that has high rates of poverty, large numbers of new and undocumented immigrants, and many families who speak languages other than English at home. Using a Bourdieusian theoretical framework, this study investigates teachers' recognition of their own habitus and that of families and of the doxa within the field of the school. This study asks the teachers, by their own accounts, what prevents them from greater success in developing and sustaining culturally sustaining family-school partnerships.

AB  - The purpose of the study addressed in this article was to gather information from military service members and their teenage children attending Extension camping programs together. We used a pretest and a posttest to examine resilience of both groups and compared other postprogram youth outcome measures to a normative sample. We found statistically significant increases in resilience scores for both service member participants and teenage participants as well as elevated youth outcomes in the areas of problem solving and connecting with others. Our results constitute useful information on the value of Extension outdoor and recreational programming for family systems.

AB  - This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to comprehensive, school-based physical activity (PA) promotion among adolescents prior to and during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, considering the perspectives of students, parents, and school staff. Data were collected from 2020 to 2021 using semi-structured individual interviews with students (n = 15), parents (n = 20), and school staff (n = 8) at a Title I middle school (i.e. high percentage of students from low-income families). Two theoretical frameworks guided analysis: the Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program framework and Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. Using an iteratively developed codebook, data were coded, thematically analyzed, and synthesized. PA barriers and facilitators were present throughout the school day, at home, and in the community. Key determinants included pandemic-induced challenges (e.g. COVID-19 exposure); neighborhood characteristics/weather (e.g. neighborhood safety); school-family communication/collaboration; implementation climate (i.e. school staff's support for programming); time, spatial, and monetary resources (e.g. funding); staffing capacity/continuity and school champions; staffing creativity and adaptability; PA opportunities before, during, and after school; and child's motivation/engagement. Efforts to improve school-based PA programs, irrespective of pandemic conditions, should include strategies that address factors at the community, school, family and individual levels. School-family communication/collaboration, school staff programming support, and PA opportunities throughout the day can help promote comprehensive, school-based PA.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore parents' perspectives about the special education process during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking parents (N = 102) of children receiving special education services. Results indicated that language (English or Spanish), but not household income or parental education, was significantly associated with whether or not a child was receiving special education services during COVID-19, such that English-speaking parents were more likely to report that their child was receiving services relative to Spanish-speaking parents. The same predictors along with consideration of culture were used to examine the level of challenge children experience with online special education services. Language and consideration of one's culture were significantly associated with the level of challenge children experienced when receiving online special education services, in which Spanish-speaking parents and parents who perceived that the IEP team rarely considered their child's culture reported having more difficulty. Qualitative responses suggested that most parents were worried about their children regressing in academic gains. Preliminary results emphasize the need for understanding the perspectives of parents in navigating special education services to enhance equity in service access.

AB  - Using telehealth as a mode of service delivery has the potential to address some long-standing challenges in early intervention (EI) services such as waiting lists to access services. Yet, little is known about parent perceptions of telehealth in EI based on their lived experiences partnering with EI practitioners. The purpose of this study was to explore parent perceptions on using telehealth, especially on family-professional partnerships and coaching. Interviews were conducted with 15 parents of children receiving EI services via telehealth from June to August of 2021. Almost half of the participants reflected under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds. Constant comparative analysis and emergent coding were used for data analysis. The findings showed that the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages regarding telehealth. Participants reported that telehealth provided a safe and flexible option and eliminated the wait to access EI services. However, participants identified some disadvantages to telehealth including telehealth precluded substantive interactions with therapists and limited access to technology. The findings also indicated that telehealth enhanced family-professional partnerships. Nearly all participants valued coaching during telehealth. Participants suggested initial supports to facilitate EI via telehealth, including stable internet access, telehealth training, and an initial in-person visit. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: Drawing on the perspectives of cultural capital theory, this study investigated the impact of international internships on the performance of Japanese undergraduates on the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) using a between-group pretest-posttest experimental design. Design/methodology/approach: Students participating in international internships were compared to their counterparts in a noninternational internship control group. Using TOEIC data collected in June 2019 and September 2019, we performed t-tests and estimated a difference-in-differences model with propensity score matching to measure the impacts of participation in international internships, students' demographic information, family socioeconomic status, and independent learning characteristics. Findings: The study showed that students' participation in international internships and independent learning activities had significant effects on TOEIC performance. The findings of this study also indicate that in addition to the effects of international internship experience and independent learning on students' English performance, learner learning behavior may be important for improving students' performance. Research limitations/implications: This empirical research provides meaningful insights for parents, educators, and researchers not only in Japan but also in a broader context in which international internships and independent learning activities have a crucial impact on student performance. It also sheds light on our understanding of the role of activities conceptualized through the lens of cultural capital in educational stratification. Originality/value: This study elucidates the association among cultural capital theory, international internships, and students' linguistic achievement and makes an important contribution to the broader conceptual literature.

AB  - Family-teacher relationships in early childhood education are recognized as both important and challenging. This qualitative case study used content analysis to examine the impact of infant mental health principles on preservice teachers' communication with the parent of a child in need of early intervention. Analysis of student work suggested that they promoted students' ability to take on the perspective of the parent and focus on establishing an authentic relationship in their communication. Findings further suggest that pre-service teachers may need support in understanding the impact of positioning themselves as the expert on the developing relationship.

AB  - Home literacy experiences and observed parent and child behaviors during shared book reading were investigated in preschool-age children with hearing loss and with typical hearing to examine the relationships between those factors and children's language skills. The methods involved parent-reported home literacy experiences and videotaped parent-child dyads during shared book reading. Children's language skills were tested using the Preschool Language Scale-4. The results indicated significant differences between groups for home literacy experiences and observed parent and child behaviors. Parents of children with hearing loss were found to read more frequently to their children than parents of children with typical hearing, yet scored lower for "literacy strategies" and "teaching techniques" compared to parents of children with typical hearing. Children with hearing loss scored lower in "interactive reading" behaviors compared to children with typical hearing. For children with hearing loss, frequency of book reading and child interactive reading behaviors were strong predictive factors for children's language skills. These results suggest that families of children with hearing loss would benefit from professional support as they read storybooks to their children. Similarly, children with hearing loss should be encouraged to be more interactive during shared book reading.

AB  - Discrepancies among family members' ratings on aspects of family functioning are challenging both, methodological and interpretational. Family members' perspectives and their discrepancies are indicators of family functioning, affecting adolescents' psychological development. Previous research focused on linear effects, ignoring that rather extreme than the small differences in ratings might be associated with higher levels of problem behaviors, indicating a negative development. Based on 947 German mother-adolescent-dyads, this study examined how level and discrepant parenting ratings on parental warmth relate to early adolescents' problem behaviors (3rd-6th), using LCSMs to assess the level as well as linear and quadratic discrepancy effects. This study showed that before secondary school-transition, high mother-adolescent levels in parental warmth negatively predicted emotional and social problems. After the transition, very high levels of discrepancies positively predicted problem behaviors, when modelled as quadratic effects. The study not only highlights the consideration of multiple perspectives but also the type of modeling.

AB  - The terms parent-teacher relationship and partnership are used frequently throughout the literature in early childhood education and special education. Their prevalence may imply that we know more than we really do about what takes place between families and teachers, and how these parties cultivate and sustain relationships with one another. This qualitative study examined parents' expectations of their journey into special education and their relationships with special education preschool teachers. Data collection methods for this study included semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Findings from the study inform early childhood special education practitioners about how they might view the notions of care and expectations, and in turn develop positive and caring relationships with the families of their young students with disabilities. Furthermore, this study raises additional questions that researchers might continue to investigate in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how Noddings' ethic of care might be used as a framework for applying family-centered practices in early childhood special education.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the views of parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) regarding their burnout using a meta-synthesis method. A total of 456 articles published between 2010 and 2023, using qualitative methodologies, were analyzed, examining 10 studies. Google Scholar, DergiPark, ERIC, EBSCO, EBCSCO Academic Search Ultimate, Elsevier, SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and Wiley databases were used for study selection. The subject headings and keywords used in the searches were: 'autism spectrum disorder, parent, family, burnout, child, perspective, qualitative research. Content analysis was the preferred method during the data analysis. Using content analysis, the sampling methods, research purposes, data collection tools, and results obtained in the studies were examined. The identified data were interpreted based on frequency and occasionally presented using tables and graphs. The findings were categorized under identified themes based on the collected data. The studies examined within the scope of the research were evaluated as a whole, and five themes were reached: getting support, isolation, disruption of daily routine, anxiety, and emotional outbursts. The study's conclusions also provide recommendations for educators, parents, and future research directions.

AB  - Literature has highlighted that social relationships at school are essential to school success, yet few studies have examined this construct from parents' perspectives. Even less research has explored perceptions of social relationships in the school among parents whose children are bullying victims and potential racial-ethnic differences in the perceptions. Using self-report data from 3,261 parents of middle and high school youth, this study used multilevel analyses in which parents were nested in their child's schools and examined parent perceptions of school relationships (including Child-School Connectedness, Parent-School Connectedness, School Outreach and Involvement, and Culture of Inclusiveness and Equity) in the context of youth victimization and whether these perceptions varied by the parents' racial-ethnic background. Results showed that compared to parents whose child was not a bullying victim (63.5%), those whose child was victimized (36.5%) had poorer perceptions of school relationships and that this difference was more pronounced in some racial-ethnic groups (e.g., Asian and Black) than in others (e.g., White, Bi-or Multi-racial). These findings underscore the importance of addressing ethnic heterogeneity in how parents evaluate school-based social relationships in the context of peer bullying in order to effectively engage racial-ethnic minoritized parents of victimized youth in culturally responsive school bullying interventions.

AB  - Background: Many studies show a positive link between student achievement and family participation in school. Family participation in school can also benefit the whole educational community, contributing to a shared community responsibility for education. Despite this, in many schools, family participation can be incidental or superficial. There are also different understandings of the role of families in schools, with the term 'family participation' being ambiguous and complex. Purpose: This study aims to analyse how family participation in school is understood in one region of Spain. It explores different forms of family participation by giving voice to a range of different groups involved in students' education -- not just families and teachers. The questions guiding the study are as follows: 1) What role does communication play in family participation in schools?; 2) What are the actions taken by different stakeholders when participating?; 3) How do families approach their rights and duties when participating in school?; 4) What are the barriers to family participation?; and 5) what are the actions for improvement that favour a participatory culture? Method: A qualitative, participatory methodology was used, drawing on data collected through semi-structured interviews, both group and individual, with 44 multi-stakeholder participants. A thematic content analysis was carried out using Maxqda22, a qualitative data-analysis programme. A deductive system that generated categories was combined with an inductive system that generated codes. Findings: The key factor to achieving participation was effective communication. Sometimes, this was initiated by the school towards the family, and at other times, at the request of the family. In either case, the key to success lay in the design of communicative strategies that went beyond the transmission of information about urgent events occurring at school. Suggested solutions for improving family-school interaction included trusting in families, and training them, or providing them with the necessary tools to approach their participation. Conclusions: Participation varies in its nature and occurs when there is a shared school-family project in which attitude and communication play an important role. Barriers to participation include ideological differences, and a lack of genuine awareness of the importance of the role that families can play in school. The main proposal to promote family participation is to find ways to overcome individualism through shared projects.

AB  - Background: With the right support, people with learning disabilities can be 'good enough' parents (Coren et al., 2011; Murphy & Feldman, 2002). Parenting programmes exist to support parents and are made accessible for people with learning disabilities who are expecting a baby, but evaluation of the benefit of these interventions is poor due to a lack of accessible outcome measures (May & Harris, 2020; Wade et al., 2008). The Tool to Measure Parenting Self-Efficacy in the antenatal period (TOPSE ante-natal) measures the impact of parenting interventions on an individual's self-efficacy during the antenatal period. This study aimed to modify the TOPSE ante-natal tool through a process of inclusive research, to support a consistent approach to evaluating parenting interventions from the perspective of parents-to-be with learning disabilities. Methods: A two-phase study using interviews and discussion groups was conducted in a process of inclusive research to modify the TOPSE ante-natal tool. Phase one involved conducting eight cognitive interviews (interviews to understand how individuals process and recall information) with parents with learning disabilities. These were conducted remotely via Microsoft Teams, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis (Krippendorff, 2013). Participants were recruited using snowballing techniques through the advisory groups' networks. Phase two included three discussion groups with study collaborators and advisors (n = 14) to assess the accessibility and acceptability of adaptations of the tool, each making further refinements for consideration. Findings: Interviews and discussion groups highlighted how parents-to-be with learning disabilities experienced some of the original TOPSE-ante-natal negative statements, including negative points on a Likert scale, difficult to comprehend. Figurative statements and unfamiliar words also caused confusion, and statements focussed on the pressures of parenting were experienced as confrontational by people with learning disabilities. Statements were removed or replaced and agreed upon in discussion groups to ensure that the tool was accessible and meaningful to people with learning disabilities. Conclusions: We have used a process of inclusive research to modify a self-efficacy tool for parents-to-be with learning disabilities that is freely available on the TOPSE website (https://www.topse.org.uk/site/). The next steps are for this tool to be used and validated in future studies evaluating parenting interventions for people with learning disabilities. This will inform a knowledge base of what interventions should be used by practitioners who are supporting people with learning disabilities to prepare for parenthood.

AB  - This qualitative study was designed to understand parents' perceptions of their children's participation in an inclusive surf therapy programme in the United States. Ten parents and one caregiver were interviewed about theirs and their children's experience in the surf programme. Parent discussions centred on the child, parent/caregiver, instructor and challenges of parenting. Results indicate that parents perceive surf therapy to positively impact their child physically, socially and behaviourally. Findings also suggest cost, an inclusive, family-centred approach and opportunities for socialisation with other families were important to parents' satisfaction.

AB  - Background: ETAP-1 was created to evaluate the quality of services trajectory from families' perspective. The items of ETAP-1 were developed from previous studies on integrated care, existing quality assessments, and consultations with families and experts in evaluation and in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method: The questionnaire was completed by 200 parents of children aged 5 and under who were recently diagnosed with ASD or intellectual disability. Of these, 183 received diagnostic evaluation through a clinic specialized in ASD; the other 17 underwent diagnostic evaluation in hospital settings. Results: Factor analysis supported the a priori dimensions of quality and distinctions between experiences before and during diagnostic evaluation. The instrument had high internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity with other measures and was sensitive to differences in service delivery models. Discussion: ETAP-1 is useful in organizing information on families' experiences throughout their services trajectories and according to a dynamic perspective.

AB  - The study explores language maintenance and shift patterns from a family language policy perspective in Azerbaijani-Farsi bilingual families in the City of Zanjan, Iran. The city is the capital of Zanjan province which is surrounded by Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Farsi speaking provinces giving it a specific demographic make-up to explore language maintenance and shift processes from a family language policy perspective. Thirteen parents (six fathers and seven mothers) from upper, middle, and lower socioeconomic statuses were interviewed about their language ideologies, practices, and management with respect to the maintenance of their ethnic language, Azerbaijani, and the official language of the country, Farsi. The findings suggest that despite the parents' strong attachment to their ethnic language, they promote Farsi at home. The parents' own and their children's competence in and knowledge of Azerbaijani has been reportedly declined. The analysis shows that this shift to Farsi at home has its roots in an unfavourable language ecology in which families find themselves.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has generated social and economic disruptions, resulting in cascading effects on the health and well-being of global citizens. However, little research has focused on how COVID-19 has affected rural regions, despite rurality being a critical factor for understanding community impact and response to the pandemic. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the experiences of rural Nebraskan parents with young children during the COVID-19 pandemic and school shutdown, and the strategies they used to support their families during that time. We conducted individual and group interviews with 22 white, non-Hispanic mothers living in rural towns, villages, and farms in the Great Plains region of the United States. Thematic analysis was used to generate the following themes related to pandemic challenges: "Impacts on Children's Education and Development," "Impact on Parent's Work," and "Social-Emotional Impacts." Additionally, we generated themes related to the ways that rural parents responded to those challenges: "Successful Parenting Strategies," "Children's Strategies," "Using Community Provided Resources," "Finding Unexpected Benefits," and "Hope." This study is meaningful because it documented the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and school shutdown on rural families with young children, and their responses to pandemic-related stressors. Our findings provide further insights into families' experiences of how COVID-19 affected their lives. Limitations and future directions are also discussed.

AB  - Although it is well-documented that families of children with autism in developed nations report hardships, few researchers have focused on families who live in less-developed, low-resource settings. Using five focus groups with 30 parents of children with autism in Mongolia, a low-resource setting, the purpose of this study was to provide detailed accounts of their experiences, challenges, and needs. Participants reported severe challenges related to raising their children with autism in their country. Parents shared barriers related to the limited availability of services and support, exacerbated financial burdens, and a lack of enforcement of relevant laws. Parents also shared their perceived needs including more services for their children, more sustainable training and coaching programs for parents, and parents' collective advocacy.

AB  - This phenomenological study aimed at exploring home learning experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on the home learning environment after school closures during the early days of the pandemic in Turkey. The purposively selected sample included parents (n=16) of 6-13 years old primary and elementary school students and classroom teachers (n=18). The findings revealed that educational inequalities and family socioeconomic characteristics, support, and interest affected home learning experiences and the transformation of homes into learning environments. System-level constraints decreased the contributions of remote learning.

AB  - The complexity of language contact and intercultural communication has generated various issues in relation to language use and education. As one of the many Chinese dialects ("fangyans"), the Chaoshan dialect ("Teochew") has been affected by the extensive promotion of Putonghua, the key lingua franca across China, and English, the lingua franca for international communication. Therefore, it is worth exploring the current situation and sustainability of Teochew from the perspective of multilingualism. This study used a questionnaire and interviews with local Chaoshan people as the research instruments with which to investigate the perspective of family language policy, the usage frequency of Teochew on different occasions and among different groups, parents' and students' levels of Teochew mastery and the factors influencing the family language policy of Teochew. It also aimed to determine the participants' first-language practices and attitudes towards Teochew. The findings reveal that the majority of the participants have positive attitudes regarding the inheritance and development of Teochew; however, the future of sustainable development shows a weakening trend. The paper concludes by emphasising the significance of maintaining Teochew as one of the many fangyans in China, in addition to the "lingua franca," as seen from a multilingual perspective.

AB  - Parental engagement in education has proven to be important to children's academic success. Research suggests that when parents are involved in their children's schooling, children tend to be motivated learners, have high educational aspirations, get good grades, and experience a sense of school belonging (Cheung & Pomerantz, 2012; Hill et al., 2004; Kuperminc, Darnell, & Alvarez-Jimenez, 2007). Research also shows that the advantages of parental involvement benefit all students, including minority and immigrant students (Jeynes, 2003). In light of globalization, schools in many Western countries such as Canada and the United States receive large numbers of immigrant and refugee students each year. As a result of these demographic shifts, ways to engage culturally diverse parents are gaining increased attention in the literature. Interest in best practices and models of working with culturally diverse families is growing. This article seeks to contribute to this body of knowledge by reporting on a case study of refugee parent engagement. Specifically, this article reports on how inclusive parent engagement was understood and facilitated in the context of a multi-agency program for refugee families in an urban center in Western Canada.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the parental mediation of children's internet use from middle school students' point of view. In doing so, we first developed a Parental Mediation Scale. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor structure (monitoring, safety, active, technical mediation), which was then verified through confirmatory factor analysis. After conducting validity and reliability studies of the scale, we applied it to 416 Turkish middle school students in the 2018-2019 school year. To examine the parental mediation of internet use in terms of demographic characteristics, we employed group comparison tests (i.e., independent samples t-Test and one-way ANOVA). The results indicated that middle school students perceived the mediation of their parents at a medium level. Moreover, parental mediation of internet use did not differ based on the age of children, child's level of education, the gender of children, number of children in the family, parents' level of education, and family's income level.

AB  - Challenging behaviors are linked to negative long-term developmental outcomes for young children with disabilities and remain a primary focus of service delivery for many early intervention practitioners and families. Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a tiered prevention framework that recommends evidence-based positive behavior support (PBS) strategies to effectively address young children's challenging behaviors and promote prosocial skills. However, there is limited research investigating the feasibility of a PBIS approach in Part C early intervention settings, which employ a family-centered approach to serve an increasingly culturally and linguistically heterogeneous population of young children and their families. This article presents findings from a convergent mixed methods study aiming to understand the impact of PBIS approach components implemented in an early intervention context (PBIS-EI) to support diverse families in addressing children's challenging behaviors at home. EI practitioners' implementation of PBS strategies is measured over time and practitioner experiences with supporting parents' use of PBS strategies are explored via qualitative interviews. Findings show increases in EI practitioner confidence and implementation of strategies, as well as practitioner-reported experiences. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

AB  - The implementation of lockdowns that include the closure of educational facilities for face to face teaching has been one of the strategies used internationally to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Research suggests lockdowns are associated with negative impacts on children's psycho-social functioning, Most research, however, has been conducted in countries where extended lockdown periods have been in place and has primarily used parent/child survey to gain insight into lockdown effects. The current study was conducted in the context of New Zealand's initial 7-week national lockdown which allowed examination of the impact of a relatively short lockdown period. Participants (n = 139) aged 10 to 13 years from one school were interviewed face to face about their experiences during lockdown immediately following the re-opening of schools. Participants' self-concept was also evaluated to gain an understanding of their psycho-social skills after lockdown. Qualitative analysis identified positive and negative features of lockdown from children's perspectives. Analysis also focused on changes to children's relationships with close family members during lockdown. The findings have implications for identifying how to optimise lockdown experiences for children.

AB  - The unprecedented school closures in response to COVID-19 have been associated with a number of negative impacts on students and their families. In addition to these difficulties, parents of students with disabilities are faced with prepandemic stresses and challenges that may be exacerbated by the school closures. This qualitative study aimed to investigate the experiences and struggles of parents of children identified with a disability during the COVID-19 school closures. The 15 participants were parents of children with a range of disabilities, including Autism, Down Syndrome, ADHD, and learning disabilities. The analyses revealed four major themes: school connection, virtual learning, potential impacts for students, and managing change. The experiences of these caregivers during the COVID-19 school closures and subsequent shift to remote learning have implications for educational and treatment planning. Recommendations for how school psychologists and school teams may best support students with disabilities and their families are included.

AB  - Background: Respite care has traditionally been conceptualised as a short residential break which allows families a break from caring responsibilities. In recent years, alternative respite services have been developed which promote greater social integration and normalisation for people with intellectual and other disabilities. Specific aim: The present study sought to explore the views of service managers and families on the definitions, aims, outcomes and general experiences of these programmes among a sample of adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) using a range of alternative respite services. Method: Participants were managers of respite services for people with ID (n = 6) and family members (predominantly parents, n = 32) of adults receiving respite services from these organisations. All participants were provided with appropriate information on the study and gave consent. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore participants' perspectives on alternative respite provision for adults with ID. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, with multiple analysts involved to allow for reflection on the interpretation of data. Findings: Managers and families showed diversity in the conceptualisations of respite services, with themes highlighting the importance of the break for both people with ID and families, as well as a clear focus on the needs of and developmental outcomes for the person with ID. As such respite was viewed as both a model of service and an outcome for families and individuals with ID. These differing views appeared to have implications for views on who was the target beneficiary of respite. Discussion: The present study reflects alternative respite as a diverse experience for people with ID, their family members and the service providers supporting them. Nevertheless, views were generally positive. Further consideration of the nature of respite services beyond the traditional conceptualisation is warranted.

AB  - A child language broker is an individual who is interpreting between two parties due to a language difference. Previous research has focused on the parentification, undue burden, and stress on the child who is engaging in this practice. While these concerns are well researched and valid, there is a positive lens to the system in which this child language broker operates. Designed from an interpretivism framework, this qualitative study specifically focused on the experiences and positive memories of eight, Spanish speaking college students who have language brokered throughout their entire lives. To understand their perspectives about what their life experiences entailed, each participant completed a semi-structured interview with the researcher. The results of this study indicated that there are many positive and protective factors associated with language brokering as a child, adolescent, as well as an adult. Findings in the areas of increased pride in culture, as well as language, public perception of the family, and positive memories of language brokering, are discussed. While this study detailed how adult language brokers reflect on their experiences, additional research is needed to further understand the sources of resilience and family dynamics contributing to their experience and feelings regarding language brokering.

AB  - Rapidly becoming the largest ethnic group of American students, compared to White students with disabilities, Latino students with disabilities receive less services and their parents are more likely to struggle to receive services. Yet, it is unclear how Latino families advocate for their children with disabilities including how cultural values facilitate their advocacy efforts. In this study, four focus groups were conducted with 46 Latino parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Parents reported advocating by being assertive but not aggressive, being involved in school activities, communicating with the school and documenting the communication, and relying on knowledge and faith. Parents also reported facilitators (i.e., knowledge and resources, increased parent-school communication, and greater peer support) and barriers (i.e., poor school experiences, school related-stress, and stigma and discrimination) to advocacy. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: In Korea, private tutoring is considered a social evil that damages the capacity of public schooling and undermines social justice. Although the government has implemented various policies to reduce private tutoring, ranging from improving the quality of education to providing "quasi-private tutoring" programs and regulating the shadow education market, total spending on private tutoring has continued to increase. This study examines a little noticed but important cause of institutionalized private tutoring in Korea. Design/Approach/Methods: The study employed a socio-ecological perspective to analyze both education and socio-structural factors. An extensive review of the government's private tutoring reduction policies and related literature was conducted. Findings: Private tutoring functions as a means by which parents can help their children compete for admission to prestigious universities and pass on wealth and social status to their children. Participation in private tutoring has become a social norm that is taken for granted. The root causes of institutionalized private tutoring lie in both educational and socio-structural factors. Originality/Value: The study suggests that government policies, when ignoring the long-established "grammar" of parents about children's education, may either end in failure or produce unintended consequences.

AB  - This article reports on research investigating the aspirations of pupils in primary schools located in low-socioeconomic areas in one English county. The research adopted a qualitative approach to explore aspirations, self-efficacy, opinions regarding the merits of investment in education, and notions of perceived future selves. The research also considered the expectations of parents and teachers providing insight into how they support children's aspirations and expose them to opportunities and ideas. The study utilised various trigger activities as a precursor to focus groups. The findings show a distinct gap between pupils' conception of their current selves and their future selves whereby there is uncertainty and insecurity about the appropriate steps needed to make informed choices and realise aspirations. Parents and extended family are the predominant idea source for aspirations and their assistance is recognised, above all, as important by pupils. Aspirations are also fashioned by pupils' gender-specific ideas about certain jobs and cultural exposure to the media. Pupils discern the importance of working hard and performing well at school. Most parents just want their child to be happy in the future and, as such, would support their child's career choices believing these could be achieved although believing qualifications are important, and the job market restricted. Teachers want their pupils to have options but identify barriers to achieving aspirations as worklessness in families, the locality of the school, low self-efficacy and unrealistic aspirations.

AB  - Despite a history dating from 1969, the current status of the Saudi gifted education environment is yet to be fully determined. Saudi gifted students and their parents were asked to complete Saudi-language versions of the Family Educational and Learning Capitals Questionnaire and the Student Educational and Learning Capitals Questionnaire to assess participant perceptions of the availability the 11 educational and learning capitals of the Actiotope Model of Giftedness. After transforming the responses into Rasch measures, matched paired comparisons of nearly 100 Saudi parents and their children were obtained. Our findings indicate that parents and their children differ in terms of their perceptions in the availability of four of the five educational capitals ("economic," "infrastructural," "didactic," and "aspirational capital"), and three of the five learning capitals ("attentional," "actional" and "episodic capitals"). We discuss the origins of both these differences and similarities before outlining the implications of our findings in terms of the effectiveness of the learning environment to support gifted education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Whereas previous research has examined the role that parenting and home environments play in explaining the relation between family socioeconomic status and children's language development in the United States, relatively little is known about the associations between these constructs in other cultures. This study tested an integrated model of language development within a longitudinal data set of 1,894 socioeconomically diverse Korean children (48.35% girls; > 99% native-born Korean citizens) from the first year of life (age 3-8 months) to ages 3 and 6 years. A model integrating parent and environmental characteristics from the family stress model and the family investment model that also included maternal self-efficacy and knowledge of child development was shown to adequately explain the associations between family socioeconomic status and children's language development. Implications for applying similar integrated models in international contexts are discussed.

AB  - The intersection of mass incarceration and fatherhood is of particular interest to a growing number of scholars, policymakers, and practitioners. In this study, the role of fathers in children's lives before and during imprisonment are investigated from the caregiver perspective. Reliance on caregivers' accounts offers valuable insight into the complexities of fathers' involvement with children prior to and during incarceration. Data come from the Arizona Children of Incarcerated Parents (COIP) project and rely on in-depth interviews with a diverse set of 53 caregivers of children, including mothers (current/former partners), grandparents, extended family, and non-relatives. Findings reveal that while slightly more than half of caregivers (58%, n = 31) reported involvement by fathers in the lives of children prior to prison, considerably more (81%, n = 43) reported contact between fathers and children during imprisonment. Thematic content analysis was conducted to explore key themes in caregivers' narratives to explain the continuity and disconnects in fatherhood. Overall, results highlight the need for intervention efforts that focus on incarcerated fathers and their children that are cognizant of variation in family life, as well as the central role of caregivers.

AB  - Although class differences and intra-class diversity in children's engagement in organised extracurricular activities have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to internal family dynamics and conjugal negotiation in enrolling children in these activities. From the perspectives of gendered parenting and relational sociology, this study draws on qualitative data from 134 parents in 81 urban Chinese families to reveal their conjugal disagreements, negotiation and coping tactics in enrolling their children in extracurricular activities. The findings indicate that selecting and managing extracurricular activities for children is an ongoing process marked by constant conjugal negotiation, the relational agency of multiple family members and various coping tactics within the family. These findings enrich the literature by highlighting the complexity of middle-class parenting in negotiating children's extracurricular educational resources and shed new light on the relational and contested processes of gendered parenting and making familial decisions about children's education.

AB  - Evaluations of gifted education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are hampered by the lack of clear policy objectives as well as practical difficulties in obtaining data. Furthermore, it is unclear if the specific needs of gifted students are unique or shared across non-gifted students. In the current research, both gifted and non-gifted Saudi students (n = 284) and their parents completed Saudi-language versions of the Student Educational and Learning Capitals Questionnaire and the Family Educational and Learning Capitals Questionnaire, respectively, to assess the availability of 11 educational and learning capitals. Additionally, parents reported the major challenges to their child's learning and what they did to support their children. Rasch modeling was used to assess the measurement properties of the two instruments and to transform the raw scores into Rasch scores (logits). The results indicated that gifted students and their parents differed in their evaluations of economic and social educational capitals, as well as organismic, telic, and attentional learning capitals that support their learning success, with estimates of effect size ranging from small to large. However, the differences between non-gifted students and their parents are similar, showing that the challenges facing Saudi gifted students are shared more generally among non-gifted students.

AB  - Background: There are many children with neurodisability who are unable to rely on speech to communicate and so use a range of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods and strategies to get their message across. Current instruments designed to measure the outcomes of speech and language therapy interventions lack specific attention to communication outcomes that are valued by non-verbal children with neurodisability, their families and support networks. This qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted to identify valued communication outcomes to inform the next stage of developing a novel outcome measure. Aims: To systematically identify and synthesise the qualitative evidence about which communication outcomes non-verbal children with neurodisability, their family members, healthcare professionals and educators think are important to achieve, specifically which communication outcomes are most valued by: (1) non-verbal children with neurodisability; (2) parents or other family members of non-verbal children with neurodisability; and (3) professionals who work with non-verbal children with neurodisability. Methods & Procedures: A systematic search of bibliographic databases and the grey literature was undertaken to identify qualitative studies that included evidence of views expressed by children, family members, healthcare professionals and educators on outcomes in relation to the communication of non-verbal children with neurodisability. All papers meeting the inclusion criteria were quality appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative checklist, although none were excluded on this basis. The data synthesis involved organising coded data into descriptive themes which were then synthesised into analytical themes. Main Contribution: We found 47 papers containing qualitative data meeting the inclusion criteria from research situated in 14 countries. The views of 35 children, 183 parents, six other family members, 42 healthcare professionals and 18 educators are represented in the review. The included studies contained very few data reported by children themselves; most data were provided by adults, especially parents. Three main analytical themes were identified: Experiences of communication and expectations; adapting to and acceptance of AAC; and becoming an autonomous communicator. Conclusions & Implications: This meta-synthesis brings together the limited qualitative research findings about what parents, professionals and children consider are important communication outcomes for non-verbal children with neurodisability. The synthesis identifies key gaps in our knowledge about the perspectives of children and their siblings. This synthesis will inform primary research to understand valued communication outcomes in this group, and ultimately the development of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that can be used to demonstrate the effect of interventions, at both clinical and service levels.

AB  - Understanding the needs of parents with children with hearing loss (HL) is necessary to best support both the children and their families beyond what they have received in early intervention programs. The objective of this paper is to present the perspective of parents regarding their participation in a group intervention with their child and the impact this had on them as the parent of a child with HL. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews completed after the group intervention. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Two main themes emerged: (1) opportunities and the need for continued support, and (2) connections and joy. These results support the need for programs that offer ongoing strategies, resources, and connectedness for families beyond early intervention initiatives.

AB  - Mothers are often the primary parent participants in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research. As a result, little is known about fathers' perceptions regarding their children's ASD and whether these perceptions differ from mothers'. Given the limited information available regarding fathers' perceptions about their children's ASD, this study aimed to investigate father variables (stress, coping, support, and perception of disability) and how they compare to mothers'. Participants were 361 biological parents (294 mothers and 67 fathers) of children on the autism spectrum who participated in a larger study. Results revealed significant differences between mothers' and fathers' self-reported stress and coping. Understanding differences between parents' perspectives has both research and clinical implications for working with families raising children on the autism spectrum.

AB  - Many autistic youths experience restricted school participation. The present study investigated the influences of youth, family and school factors on autistic youths' school participation. Parents of 200 Dutch autistic youths (age range: 4-16 years, M[subscript age] = 12.23 years, SD[subscript age] = 2.93 years) filled in questionnaires in a national survey for autistic individuals, reporting the school participation, age and autistic traits of their child, parents' education level and self-efficacy for supporting their child's schoolwork, and the impact of problems their child experienced with the physical and social environments of the school. Multivariate linear regression analysis using imputed data revealed that among the six predictor variables, only the impact of problems autistic youths experienced with the physical environment of school was negatively associated with their school participation. This study provided support for the essential role of the school environment in predicting autistic youths' school participation, indicating that problematic aspects in the school environment could have a greater impact on autistic youths' school participation than youth factors or family factors. This highlights the need to create a more accommodating environment at school, where autistic youths can participate easily and comfortably.

AB  - This study investigated the impact on Hispanic pre-service teachers' self-efficacy toward parental involvement as a result of having been engaged in a unique form of professional development (PD) that merged authentic field experiences with direct interactions with parents of ELs. Thirty (n=30) pre-service bilingual generalists were engaged in this unique form of PD for one semester. The study also investigated how pre-service teachers' dispositions about parental involvement changed as a result of the PD. Pre-service teachers improved their self-efficacy in four areas: Family Life and Instruction, Communication and Collaboration with Parents; Engaging Parents in the Classroom and Strategies of Teaching Involving Parents. The follow-up qualitative inquiry identified how participants' knowledge blind spots were covered by participating in this type of PD.

AB  - There is a need to engage people with chemistry and to facilitate learning about chemistry in both nonformal and informal learning environments. A variety of platforms have been used to achieve this, including science festivals, summer camps, and so on. The events are voluntary, and participants need to be motivated independently to engage. The aim of the study was to systematically investigate what motivates children and their parents to participate in a specific nine-month chemistry course designed for families. The findings apply to a variety of chemistry outreach events. The present study was conducted with 342 participating parents and children who voluntarily enrolled in a chemistry family learning course which consisted of multiple events. Motivation to participate was investigated using a questionnaire, which was administered directly before participation. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses. Children and parents displayed similarities and differences regarding their motivation to participate. They both assigned the highest values to the dimensions of "research and experimentation," "individual learning and pursuing interests," "social enjoyment," and "social learning." However, there are striking differences in the order of these dimensions for each group. As such, children and parents should be regarded as two distinct target audiences for a chemistry family learning course. It might also be useful for other recurring programs to know the participants' motivation to participate. In this study, it was strongly indicated that the course was a way to reengage adults with chemistry through their role as parents. This finding might also change the perspective on parents as participants in other chemistry outreach events.

AB  - This qualitative study focuses on the changing system of professional care for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in post-Soviet Kazakhstan. We have explored parents' experiences of caring for a child with ASD focusing on their perceptions of educational, health and social support services available to them in their communities. Focus group discussions with 17 parents raising children with ASD were conducted in two major cities of Kazakhstan. Focus group interview data were transcribed and analysed using open coding and axial coding procedures. The following main themes and categories were identified and discussed: delayed detection of ASD and multiple pathways to the diagnosis; challenges for families in accessing and receiving health care for children with ASD in the public health care system; obstacles to accessing special education and a lack of inclusive education programmes for children with ASD; limited public benefits and social services available for these families in their communities; the lack of support from professional service providers in aiding parents with children ASD; and low public awareness of the disorder in the society. Drawing on family caregivers' perspectives, recommendations for policy-makers and service providers are given to strengthen the care for children with ASD in Kazakhstan.

AB  - Grounded in bioecological theories, this mixed-method article examines aspects of culturally responsive organized activities. Study 1 used path analysis to quantitatively test relations between ethnic cultural features of activities (ways of integrating ethnic culture) and concurrent experiences (N = 150 Latino adolescents). Findings were mixed, such that some features (e.g., teaching ethnic culture) predicted positive (e.g., increased autonomy) and negative (e.g., emotional) experiences. Study 2 disentangled the nuances of ethnic culture by qualitatively exploring perspectives on three features (N = 34 Mexican-origin adolescent-parent dyads): ethnic cultural content, same-ethnic leaders/peers, and Spanish language use. Thematic analysis revealed the complexities of ethnic culture. Some parents and adolescents wanted activities that represented mainstream American culture; others wanted Latino ethnic culture, but were unhappy with the ways it was integrated into activities. Parents and adolescents thought their ethnic culture was misrepresented (e.g., Cinco de Mayo was celebrated as Mexican Independence Day) or represented narrowly (e.g., La Bamba was the school band's only Mexican song). Findings suggest that integrating ethnic cultural features is not an "all or nothing" decision, and how it is done matters considerably. Families' perspectives and voice would help ensure ethnic culture is integrated in authentic, preferred ways.

AB  - Background: Many parents with learning difficulties face high rates of child welfare intervention and child removal. In contrast to other high-income countries, there has not been any published research on the lives of mothers and fathers with learning difficulties from an Austrian perspective. After presenting an insight into the international literature and the Austrian context, original empirical findings relevant to providing professional support for parents with learning difficulties are introduced. Method: As part of a larger qualitative study, ten individual parents with learning difficulties (six mothers and four fathers) were interviewed to gain insight into their experience of motherhood and fatherhood. During the interviews, participants were asked to visualise their social networks through network maps that were then included into analyses. The current paper primarily engages with parents' experience of professional practice based on a hermeneutic analysis of latent and manifest meanings. Findings: The study results reinforce the relevance of social networks, including (a lack of) professional parenting support, and gendered parental self-understandings in relation to barriers for parents with learning difficulties in Austria. Parents often experienced surveillance from child welfare professionals and referred to "being checked on" as well as receiving "the wrong support". Only one study participant experienced the (flexible and self-determined) support provided to her family as helpful. Mothers and fathers with learning difficulties face, at times, quite different challenges in the parenting role. The findings highlight a maternal self-understanding as being primarily responsible for their child, while fathers often felt excluded from their child's life. Conclusions: Support services need to acknowledge the relevance of gendered parenting roles and intersections of multidimensional disadvantages. The parenting support currently available to mothers and fathers with learning difficulties (if available at all) needs radical improvement and nationwide support structures need to be installed in collaboration with families.

AB  - Notions of "student success" feature prominently in emerging educational discourses and policy orientations. Current policy frameworks focusing on equity, performance, and reconciliation claim to offer validation for perspectives of Indigenous peoples and other racialized communities, but they are simultaneously raising the stakes for individual responsibility and performance. This paper explores these developments by examining how Indigenous students and family members understand and experience educational success in relation to the notions of success advanced by school systems. We present a case study conducted in Alberta, Canada, drawing on data from ten focus groups with 77 Indigenous youth and parents of Indigenous children connected to one school division. Highlighting the ways that social and educational policy frameworks related to employability and performance exacerbate contradictions inherent in settler colonial societies, we reveal how school systems, despite claims to the contrary, continue to adopt practices that undermine the capacity for many Indigenous people to achieve their aspirations.

AB  - This article explores how international-mindedness is defined and cultivated in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Program (MYP) schools in different regions of the world as young adolescents face their main developmental task of identity development. An online survey that contained demographic and open-ended questions was administered to MYP students. Mixed methods design and data analysis provided insight into the ways international-mindedness is experienced and developed within the IB community. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis from which a grounded theory emerged. The most frequently mentioned themes in defining international-mindedness were understanding, awareness, and acceptance of different others. Respondents emphasized that family and school experiences were the main factors that influenced their international-mindedness with travel being frequently mentioned in both. Factors, such as make-up of participants' families, their history of moving internationally, and the advice and modeling provided by parents and extended family as well as school experiences (e.g., field trips, debates, multicultural classrooms, curriculum focus) significantly contributed to their high self-ranked stance on the developmental continuum of international-mindedness. Consistency in responses across the regions demonstrate a paradigmatic understanding of international-mindedness among the respondents.

AB  - Problem: Few factors are as important to student success as family engagement in the educational process. One overarching barrier to perceived parental/caregiver involvement in urban high schools is the use of traditional definitions of family involvement, which are still espoused by school personnel, that place an emphasis on one-way school-based communication and events. Method: This quantitative study surveyed 39 caregivers in a lower SES, predominantly African American urban high school to discover these caregivers' beliefs and in-home practices regarding family engagement at the high school level. Results: Findings suggest that the majority of these caregivers regularly engage in various at-home activities in their student's education. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of schools reexamining their definitions of family engagement and co-creating unique ways to discover and incorporate caregivers' beliefs and in-home practices into urban schools.

AB  - The article reports the results of a case study of Pakistani parents' involvement with their children's school in a Foundation Stage setting in Southern England. The context includes the difficulties some children and families from ethnic minorities can experience within the English education system and a growing awareness of the importance of parental involvement. Detailed interviews were conducted with parents from twelve families (most in the parents' mother tongue) and relevant staff. Most parents and school staff were very positive about parental involvement but levels of involvement were mostly low. Many parents did not feel welcomed and got little information and guidance. They did not understand teaching methods in relation to play and mathematics. The school staff attributed low levels of involvement to parents not valuing such involvement and their lack of education. The study shows a significant level of misunderstanding and lack of communication between school and parents.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in school closures worldwide and unexcused absences have increased since schools reopened. Aims: Drawing on multiple stakeholders' perspectives, we aimed to (i) develop a detailed understanding of how school attendance problems (SAPs) have manifested for primary school-aged children in the context of COVID-19; and (ii) identify promising community-based intervention strategies. Methods: We used a qualitative design with two sequential phases of data collection. Phase 1 involved insight generation using qualitative surveys with parents and professionals working in primary education settings. These results were used to guide in-depth stakeholder interviews in Phase 2. Sample: Phase 1 included 29 parents of primary-school children experiencing SAPs and 19 professionals. Phase 2 included 10 parents and 12 professionals. Parents were recruited through social media; professionals were identified through schools and associated networks in Southern England. Results: Attendance was particularly challenging for children with special educational needs and pre-existing anxiety problems. Compounding factors included COVID-related anxiety, difficulties adapting to new school routines, poor home-school communication and collaboration, and concerns about academic catch-up. Effective support was characterized by schools and families working closely together. Recommendations for practice improvements centred on early intervention, re-building parent-school relationships, peer support for parents, and improving special educational provision. Conclusion: New interventions for SAPs must be sensitive to the ongoing COVID-19 context. Help should be easily accessible in the community and address modifiable risk and protective factors for individual children, in family systems, and at the home-school interface.

AB  - Research Findings: This study investigates the ideal and realistic second-child fertility willingness of Chinese parents and the associated factors. Altogether 4,510 Chinese parents of only-child (ages 3-6 years) were sampled and surveyed online. The descriptive and logistic regression analyses indicated that: (1) about 74.1% of the parents were ideally willing to have two children and preferred a female second-child, but less than one-third of them reported having definite fertility intentions and plans; (2) the ideal pattern of second-child fertility willingness was positively associated with family income, whereas a V-shaped relationship was found between fertility intentions and plans and family income levels after realistic consideration; (3) the child-rearing pressure has caused a gap between the ideal and realistic perspectives of fertility willingness, with parental fertility beginning to transition toward a contemporary individual preference-centered orientation. Practice or Policy: The findings imply that policy attention should be paid to the pressure and needs of family fertility by linking fertility policies with providing adequate support to parents.

AB  - To advance understanding of parents' and adolescents' unique and shared perspectives of familism, a core cultural value in Mexican-origin families, our study addressed 2 goals. First, we identified family members' unique and shared perspectives of familism values using multitrait-multimethod confirmatory factor analysis (Kenny & Kashy, 1992). Second, we examined links between family members' unique and shared perspectives of familism values and mother-youth and father-youth warmth and conflict. Participants were mothers, fathers, and 2 siblings (M[subscript age] = 15.48 years for older and M[subscript age] = 12.55 years for younger siblings) from 246 Mexican-origin families who were interviewed in their homes on 2 occasions over 5 years. Results indicated that familism values operated as an individual-level process more so than a family-level process and that youth's familism values were most consistently linked to parent-youth relationship quality. These findings provide novel insights into investigating family system dynamics involving familism values, suggest that youth's familism values may keep them connected to their families during adolescence, and highlight potential implications for prevention and intervention programs geared toward Mexican-origin families.

AB  - Studies from high-income populations have shown that stimulating, supportive communicative input from parents promote children's cognitive and language development. However, fewer studies have identified specific features of input supporting the healthy development of children growing up in low- or middle-income countries. The current study proposes and tests a multi-dimensional framework for understanding whether and how caregiver communicative input mediates the associations between socio-economic conditions and early development. We also examine how caregiver conceptual scaffolding and autonomy support uniquely and synergistically explain variation in child outcomes. Participants were 71 Bangladeshi families with five-year-olds who were exposed to a range of biological and psychosocial hazards from birth. Caregiver-child interactions during snack sharing and semi-structured play were coded for caregiver conceptual scaffolding, autonomy support, and child engagement. Findings indicate that the two dimensions of input were correlated, suggesting that caregivers who provided richer conceptual scaffolds were simultaneously more supportive of children's autonomy. Notably, conceptual scaffolding and autonomy support each mediated associations between maternal education and child verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Further, caregivers who supported greater autonomy in their children had children who participated in conversations more actively, and these children in turn had higher performance IQ scores. When considered simultaneously, conceptual scaffolding was associated with verbal IQ over and above autonomy support, whereas autonomy support related to child engagement, controlling for conceptual scaffolding. These findings shed new light on how environmental factors may support early development, contributing to the design of family-centered, culturally authentic interventions.

AB  - Adopting a sociocultural standpoint, the present study investigated Greek early years professionals' experience of the compulsive distance learning that took place in Greece due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we explored: (a) the pedagogical priorities, challenges, and opportunities teachers recognised, (b) their understanding of children's participation and interaction in digital classrooms, and (c) the role they attributed to the family context in which online education took place. Using a qualitative research perspective, we conducted 40 semi-structured interviews that were thematically analysed. Data analysis revealed that although teachers strived to make distance learning possible and joyful, they seem uncertain of how to create a meaningful, interactive, and play-based environment in their virtual classrooms. Our findings provide constructive insights into ECE teachers' experience, allowing us to discuss the arising opportunities of reconsidering participatory learning in conjunction with key interactions among teachers, children, and parents in a post-COVID world.

AB  - Early childhood education and care (ECEC) is an environment where binary discourses produce gendered bodies. Following a qualitative approach, this study has two major aims: (a) to analyze ECEC educators' and parents' perception regarding gender as a correlate for explaining toddlers' physical activity (PA) and (b) to discuss from a critical perspective how these perceptions could impact PA promotion from a very young age. The major findings were as follows: while some educators perceive no differences in PA patterns between girls and boys, others consider that girls are less active than boys and attribute this tendency to a greater propensity for symbolic play and biological determinants; and families perceive that their daughters are physically active and with natural predisposition to movement. In conclusion, despite the fact that some teachers' perceptions of young children continue to be encouraged into binary gendered practices, families show resistance and alternative ways to interpret the emphasized femininity.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic led to temporary closures of public schools and increased need for technology to support students' access to learning capabilities. The situation created enormous burdens for all education stakeholders with teachers struggling on how to package learning materials that are easily accessible to students at home, and parents struggling to structure a home learning environment to support their children. This research was conducted to develop an understanding of challenges that African Nova Scotian (ANS) parents faced when supporting their learners throughout the COVID-19 crisis. The underlying concern was that COVID-19 related school closures combined with a seismic shift in the learning environment would widen pre-existing achievement gaps among ANS learners. Utilising a methodology framed from a Participatory Action Research perspective, ANS household survey data was collected and analysed. Gaining a better understanding of how ANS students and their support network experienced remote learning is critical for the successful implementation of the current inclusive education policy in the Nova Scotia education system. With an understanding of the challenges faced by ANS learner households and perspectives for the future presented through an ANS lens, our study can help inform a more productive and inclusive public education system in the post-COVID-19 world.

AB  - Advocacy is often an expectation for parents of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). However, little is known about how advocacy may impact parent well-being, including stress, family dynamics, and marital relationships. By exploring the effects of advocacy on well-being, interventions can be implemented to support both the advocacy and well-being of parents of children with IDD. To this end, the purpose of the study was to explore the pattern between positive and negative advocacy experiences of parents of children with IDD and the well-being of parents, families, and marriages. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 parents of children with IDD. Regardless of the nature (i.e., positive, or negative) of the advocacy experience, participants reported that advocacy increased their stress. When the advocacy experience was positive, some participants reported improved family quality of life. Also, regardless of the nature of the advocacy experience, some participants reported feeling frustration within their marital relationships. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - This study addresses intergenerational learning processes in informal settings by investigating families engaging in science talk and practices during a water quality science workshop led by local science experts. As part of a larger design-based research study, this analysis examines how modified Think-Pair-Share discussion prompts within the water quality workshop curriculum supported the families' (a) sensemaking strategies and (b) place-based scientific reasoning about local water sources as they interacted with a community water model. Using sociocultural theories of learning as our foundational basis, we analyzed parent-child interactions and family sensemaking processes that took place in four workshops with 44 h of video data (12 families). Through our analysis, we identified six distinct types of sensemaking conversations that arose during the workshops: (1) family experience connection, (2) rural connection, (3) model contextualizing, (4) parent revoicing, (5) parent questioning, and (6) prediction. We also found that families spatially distributed physical gestures over three media (air, table, community water model) to support different types of sensemaking conversations. Our findings point towards the importance of family discussion prompts in informal programs as a mediational means that connects abstract science topics to local, rural experiences to support family sensemaking practices. Implications for designing family-focused science workshops in informal settings include designing discussion prompts to spark families' personally relevant connections with science and providing ample physical space for families to gesture during sensemaking conversations.

AB  - This paper reports on a study which focused on surveying children and young people (aged 4 to 17) regarding their experiences of childhood, schooling, family, and community. Participants focused on the importance of their connections to fellow children and young people, their families, and their educators. They identified ways for adults to care for them and to create connectedness and belonging whether at home or school. Participants also spoke to the value of their voices and views, and expressed a desire to be respected and recognised, whether on a personal level or with reference to broader systems such as government. Throughout the study, participants expressed appreciation regarding the opportunity to engage in research that explicitly focused on seeking and honouring their voices and views. For instance, one secondary-aged student stated, "Children can make a difference by sharing their perspective and expressing the way the world feels to them." Recommendations are posed which have heightened relevance for educators, school leaders, and parents/carers. These relate to school culture, learning and teaching, caring for children, and relating to children.

AB  - Theoretical models have posited that social contexts influence parental attitudes, which in turn modulate parental behaviors. The current study asks whether parental attitudes on bilingualism differ by local language context and whether parents who perceive bilingualism as more valuable are more likely to engage in activities with their child in their home language. We synthesize theoretical models with insights from family language policy in an ecological framework of bilingual development and test these relations in a U.S. sample of parents in 42 states. By capturing parents' perceived value of bilingualism with an online survey (n = 319) and linking responses to U.S. census data, we explored relations among local multilingualism, perceptions of the value of bilingualism, and parents' language practices. We found that parents who lived in more multilingual areas held more positive attitudes toward bilingualism, but the contribution of local multilingualism varied by language background. Local multilingualism mattered most for English-speaking parents who had never tried to learn another language, with those who lived in more multilingual areas reporting more positive perceptions of bilingualism. We also found that for parents of young children exposed to a non-English language (n = 136), those who valued bilingualism for their child were also more likely to participate in activities using their home language. These findings show how distal societal factors, such as local multilingualism, can have a cascading association with parents' perceived value of bilingualism and parents' language practices with their young children in the United States.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the interplay between home and school environments across the transition from Primary School (Year 8) to High School (Year 9) for 10 high-achieving Pasifika students and their families. Interview data from the students revealed the important role that their parents played in their education. Drawings completed by the adolescents provided a high form of data illustrating the dynamic between home and school, including the influence of both on learning. Findings revealed strong intergenerational expectations for success from the dual perspectives of parent and their children, based on cultural competency and parental high expectations. The study's results build upon existing knowledge bases which focus on parent and student strategies for success across the transition to high school, with regard to cultural competency.

AB  - Frequent social comparisons can not only influence parents' well-being but also spill over to their children's development through intergenerational influences within the family. Using data from children and their parents, the current study shows that the higher parents' social comparison orientation is, the less their children are willing to contribute to the public in a public goods game. Moreover, we find that if children interact more frequently with non-family members, the effects of parents' social comparison orientation on children's decision in public goods game become stronger. The findings of this study serve as a warning for parents and policy makers regarding the downside of excessive social comparisons and shed light on how frequent social comparisons influence human social interaction from an intergenerational perspective.

AB  - In the Maltese context, the nation-wide roll-out of State kindergarten provision in the mid-70s and the rapid increase in childcare services for under three-year-olds over the last two decades were initiatives driven by efforts to entice women to the labour market. National research to determine short and long-term effects which these services have on children's development and achievements or quality-related studies have yet to be undertaken. This article analyses responses to an open-ended question inviting parents of children in childcare and kindergarten settings, to identify three aspects indicative of 'quality'. Responses were completed by just under 2000 parents. NVivo analyses indicated that parents associate quality with practitioners' characteristics, including the care and love towards children; the relationships and communication between the settings and families; children's happiness, personal development and welfare; and physical characteristics of the setting. Knowing about parents' definitions of quality can strengthen collaboration between families and settings and encourage meaningful engagement to support young children's learning and development.

AB  - Communication between teachers and families in early childhood is a key aspect of successful teacher-family engagement. The goal of this exploratory study was to investigate how teachers communicated with families in early childhood classrooms and what they communicated about. This study of 31 teachers working with children birth to age five, primarily in the Midwestern U.S. examined how they described communication with families using semi-structured interviews. Findings indicated that teachers used multiple formats to communicate with families about children's daily routines, developmental progress, and other relevant information. Teachers preferred in-person communication although challenges occurred due to classroom dynamics and the global COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Technology such as apps and messaging emerged as an efficient way to reach most families, however difficulties facilitating reciprocal communication with families were described. Further research is needed to identify successful communication strategies for both teachers and families, thus building higher quality teacher-family partnerships.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the relationship between the positive childhood experiences of young people and family values. In the quantitative research design, descriptive and relational screening method was used in the study, and the study group consisted of 753 university students aged 18-25. Data were collected using the Positive Childhood Experiences Scale and the Family Values Scale. T-test, ANAVO, and Pearson Correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data. As a result of the study, it was determined that females and individuals with a higher family income had higher levels of positive childhood experiences. Differences in family values were found according to the participants' gender, family structure, family income status, and whether they had the desire to start a family. It was found that as the participants' positive experiences with children increased, they attributed more importance to the mother in childcare, gave more importance to relatives, had a more positive view of extended family, believed that there should be a strong mother-child connection more, gave more importance to the role of child-rearing in the family, and their emotional attachment to the family increased, the importance they attached to marriage and the institution of marriage increased, they adopted unconventional values more, they evaluated the family as conventional, and their view that the decision-making process in the family should be democratic/participatory increased, justifying violence for "family well-being" and being in favor of more freedom in matters related to sexuality decreased. Some suggestions were developed by discussing the findings in light of the literature.

AB  - Refugee families in the United States face numerous challenges in becoming acculturated. School-age children of refugees face the additional challenges of acquiring academic language and meeting school expectations for behavior and social interactions while attempting to navigate the school curriculum. This case study examines the school and home experiences of a Sudanese 1st-grade student, Elijah, in an attempt to help teachers use culturally responsive teaching practices that promote the literacy development of Sudanese children with autism and to understand the challenges, needs, and expectations of Sudanese refugee parents who have children with autism.

AB  - Literature shows that undocumented students in the United States experience significant challenges to and through higher education. Only a few studies have uncovered the mechanisms that undocumented students use to persist in college; in particular, the role that family plays on their postsecondary success is understudied. In this qualitative study, I examine the role that family plays on undocumented students' college aspirations and persistence. Findings from a sample of 16 undocumented students attending a four-year public university show that their families are the stimulus motivating them to pursue higher education, as well as the support system they can rely on to manage college barriers. However, the data also revealed that for a few participants, their families are a source of stress, resulting in additional challenges they must manage as they navigate higher education. I present these findings using participants' vignettes and conclude with implications for higher education research and practice.

AB  - Background and aims: Participatory research involves academic partners working together with the community that is affected by research to make decisions about that research. Such approaches often result in research that is more respectful of, and responsive to, community preferences -- and is vital in the context of autism research with culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. Whilst participatory approaches are becoming more commonplace within CALD autism research, no studies have explored the experiences of being involved in autism research from the perspectives of CALD community partners over the course of a study. This paper intended to address this gap by reporting on the experiences of CALD parents of autistic children who were community partners in a 1-year Australian research project exploring home-school partnerships for CALD parents of autistic children. We aimed to: (1) report on how parents' involvement in the research process shaped the home-school partnerships study over time and (2) understand their experiences of being community partners on the home-school partnerships project. Methods: Using key principles of participatory approaches, we established Chinese and Vietnamese parent advisory groups to contribute to a project exploring home-school partnerships for parents of autistic children from CALD backgrounds in Australia. Advisory groups included parents of autistic children from Chinese/Vietnamese backgrounds, as well as interpreters, professionals and researchers. We documented how parents' participation as community partners shaped the home-school partnerships study over the course of the project. We also elicited parents' own views and experiences of being community partners through informal, open-ended questions at the beginning and end of the study. Results: We found that parents' input fundamentally shaped the broader home-school partnership study, from meaningful, accurate translation of interview schedules through to making decisions regarding community-specific recommendations and dissemination plans. Parents themselves reported being keen to collaborate and to hear and share opinions for the purpose of the home-school partnership study -- although they noted how emotionally difficult sharing their stories could be. While they initially had some concerns about combining being involved as a community partner with their existing responsibilities, ultimately, parents were surprised by the scope of the home-school partnership study and their level of involvement as community partners. Through hearing others' stories and sharing their own in advisory group meetings, parents reported ancillary benefits of their involvement, including increased self-advocacy and well-being. Conclusions: These findings show how research that is conducted in partnership "with" diverse members of the autism community has the capacity to improve the quality of the research and benefit community partners. Implications: This study clearly documents the benefits and potential challenges of participatory approaches with CALD communities. These findings emphasise to researchers and funders the importance of including extra time and money within budgets in order to produce meaningful research that is respectful and responsive to communities.

AB  - Parents play a vital role in influencing their children's outdoor recreation participation. Families can enjoy nature and stay active in state parks, which provide abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation and education. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parents' experiences with, and attitudes toward, outdoor recreation and children's participation in outdoor recreation at state parks. A total of 104 parents completed an online survey in spring 2020. In state park settings, parents generally valued their children's participation in non-consumptive outdoor recreation activities more than consumptive activities. A series of chi-square analyses further indicated, however, that parents who prefer engaging in consumptive recreation activities placed higher importance on their children's participation in the consumptive activities of fishing and hunting. Parents' outdoor recreation activity preferences did not reflect differences in their own levels of physical activity but did relate to variations in their children's physical activity levels.

AB  - This study explores teacher perceptions of newcomer parents and investigates how a small sample of teachers are making the shift from deficit to asset-based approaches to working with newcomer parents. This research uses one-on-one semi-structured interviews with three Toronto District School Board high school teachers to examine their perceptions of newcomer families living in Toronto, Ontario. Critical race theory is used as the theoretical framework for this study to critically analyze teachers' conceptualization of asset-based approaches. Research findings reveal specific strategies used by the participants in incorporating asset-based approaches to working with newcomer parents and their children. This study also provides critical reflection opportunities for teachers who wish to engage in asset-based work in and beyond their multicultural classroom.

AB  - This paper reports Turkish and Chinese parents' experiences with their 3-6 year-old children during the COVID-19 quarantine process. Thirteen Turkish and 11 Chinese parents participated in a study that employed semi-structured interviews to examine participant self-perceived experiences. Findings show that the study revealed many commonalities in the experiences of Turkish and Chinese parents with their children during the COVID-19 quarantine process. Cultural differences between parents did not appear to significantly reflect the responses of parents during this extraordinary period. Parents mostly described difficulties with home quarantine. Most parents stated that their daily schedule and routines had changed as a result of home quarantine. Parents also said that they were unaware of their children's developmental progress and the extent to which their children had grown up before the quarantine. Parents shared both positive and negative experiences during the process. Since the quarantine process is an extraordinary experience for all family members, parents should be encouraged to put those positive experiences and acquisitions into their future life.

AB  - As the first study addressing family language policy (FLP) in d/Deaf-parented families in China, the current research explores language ideologies, practices and management held by different members within the families. Children of d/Deaf adults (Codas) form an unusual bimodal bilingual group, and the study concerning this group prompts us to rethink the notion of bilinguals as well as types of bilingual families within the FLP domain. The study is based on the data collected from online questionnaires, semi-structed interviews, and observations. Two versions of questionnaires were administered for both d/Deaf parents and Codas, which collected data from participants across Mainland China. Semi-structed interviews (with 10 d/Deaf parents and 4 Codas) and observations (in 4 families with underage Codas) were conducted in Shanghai. The analyses of the data suggest that language practices in d/Deaf parented families with hearing children can be viewed as miniatures of social language ecology and these families serve as micro-realisations of language socialisation, during which process both social factors on the macro level and family factors on the micro level make active contributions. Emphasised impacts are also attributed to the critical agentic roles of individuals within the families and the support given by communities and schools, whose different attitudes and practices can lead to various outcomes of the Codas' linguistic development. The study also offers new insights into the notion of successful FLP in these bimodal bilingual families.

AB  - This qualitative research study with Latina/o/x students and families who participated in a college outreach program found families imparted community cultural wealth and funds of knowledge that their children activated as they transitioned to college. The students experienced challenges due to immigration status, finances, and cultural incongruity transitioning to college. Our findings demonstrated Latina/o/x students are able to transition to college successfully by relying on their drive and the hope instilled in them through messaging from their families. Families imparted funds of knowledge and forms of community cultural wealth, including aspirational, navigational, social, and familial capital. The students then activated their funds of knowledge and community cultural wealth to overcome the obstacles they encountered in the college transition. Our research connected funds of knowledge and community cultural wealth by demonstrating Latina/o/x families and students draw on both during the college transition. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Family-program partnerships in early care and education have the potential to influence young children's development through multiple pathways. Guided by the Head Start (HS) Parent, Family, and Community Engagement (PFCE) framework, the current study uses data from the 2014 HS Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) to examine the direct, and indirect, through families' home involvement and young children's approaches to learning, associations between family-staff relationships and preschool children's receptive vocabulary and early math skills. Research Findings: Drawing on data collected from families, teachers, and direct assessments with children, and controlling for multiple child, family, and teacher factors, we found that strong family-family services staff partnerships were directly, and indirectly, through higher family-home involvement, associated with children's higher receptive vocabulary skills. In addition, we found that stronger family-teacher relationships were associated with children's stronger approaches to learning, which in turn, were associated with children's higher receptive vocabulary and early math skills. Practice or Policy: Our findings help substantiate and expand on the HS PFCE framework and help highlight the potential importance of family service staff in HS programs.

AB  - Music experience in childhood has beneficial effects on early cognitive and linguistic development. Most children under the age of five experience music every day, with family members. Yet, few studies that have focused on "Parental Musical Engagement" (PME). The issue is there are but few psychometrically standardized measures that target PME. The "Children's Music Behaviour Inventory" (CMBI) developed by Valerio and Reynolds is the 'gold standard'. The current study translated "CMBI" to Hebrew, and surveyed 300 members of the general population. The study demonstrates that "CMBI" is culture free, and presents an updated set of norms for in-home musical behaviours of children 0-5 and parent-initiated musical engagement. The article illustrates "CMBI" itself, as providing an opportunity for parents to gain insight about the value of music engagement for children under five years of age, and come to an understanding about music as an essential component within the parent-child relationship.

AB  - In the last decade, the number of public school students in the United States experiencing homelessness has more than doubled. Research shows that school enrollment processes are particularly onerous for families experiencing homelessness; yet, school choice and enrollment policies are rarely designed with the type of flexibility needed to be responsive to their multifaceted needs. In this study, we used in-depth interviews to explore the school-choice experiences of families living in shelters in New York City and to examine the knowledge and perspectives of shelter-based staff working with these families. We find that despite the New York City Department of Education's efforts to increase information provision, resource distribution, and monitoring of applications, families experiencing homelessness remained confused and frustrated by school-choice and enrollment processes. Moreover, their necessary focus on securing permanent housing, employment, and meeting their families' basic needs often limited the time they could spend searching for schools that matched their expressed preferences for an educational setting for their child. For their part, shelter staff viewed school choice and enrollment as another administrative burden added to an already extensive set of professional responsibilities, and they lacked sufficient information and training to serve as effective school-choice counselors for the families in their caseload. Taken together, our results highlight the wide-ranging, sometimes competing demands families and shelter staff living and working in the midst of multiple public systems encounter and the prioritization that must occur to comply with regulations and requirements.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the Family Involvement Questionnaire-Short Form (FIQ-SF) for use with Spanish-speaking families of children enrolled in early childhood education programs. This study examined the factor structure of the FIQ-SF and established criterion validity for the resulting FIQ-SF dimension scores. Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses replicated the three dimensions of the English FIQ: Home Engagement, School Engagement, and home-school Conferencing. Mean differences across family demographics were examined. Criterion-related validity for the three FIQ-SF dimensions was established by examining correlations with scores on measures of parent-reported satisfaction with educational experiences, program records of family engagement, direct assessments of child language skills and teacher-reported approaches to learning. Future directions and practice implications for the use of the Spanish FIQ-SF to inform program policy and interventions are discussed.

AB  - The perspective of mobile learning research has transitioned from using mobile technology for education to learning as a human and non-human practice surrounding mobility. This study exemplifies tourism in an increasingly mobile society as a mobile learning practice. Specifically, the learning of children during family travels and the mutual organization of human and non-human interactions are emphasized. Interviews with 12 Japanese parents revealed that children's touristic learning encompassed the translation of various actors in tourist destinations and the spatiotemporal creation of a knowledge network different than that of settled areas and textbooks. Family tourism suspended cultural norms by moving children to boundaries, enabling them to learn beyond the usual constraints. Moreover, this article contends that children's learning through tourism comprised negotiations with parents before tourism, accidental learning along the way, and reconfiguration of life afterward.

AB  - Disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) are the most common behavioral health problems in young American children. When not well-managed in early childhood, DBD can progress to lifetime mental health problems with personal, economic, as well as societal impacts. The evidence-based intervention of choice for DBD is outpatient parent-directed behavioral therapy (PDT). However, little is known about clinicians' perspectives on the factors influencing PDT's effectiveness in routine care. The current study directly assesses clinicians' perspectives on factors they believe impact PDT's success for disruptive behavior problems, in particular tantrums, at two outpatient behavioral therapy clinics specializing in PDT. In-depth interviews with 19 clinicians across three experience levels (doctoral intern, post-doctoral, licensed staff psychologist) were conducted and analyzed using qualitative methods. Two major themes were identified as enabling and limiting treatment success: (1) appointment attendance, (2) primary caregiver buy-in to treatment approach. Additional identified factors include caregiver's familial and social support, caregiver's physical and emotional capacities, complexity of the child's behavior problems, the extent to which the home environment can support positive changes, competing family/home demands, and care coordination among hospital programs. The primary factors identified by clinicians highlight the importance of fostering appointment attendance and parental psychoeducation that can be addressed by implementing multi-level administrative, training, and clinical initiatives to improve PDT's real-world effectiveness for DBD.

AB  - This study looks into the cultural and social influences on the provision of early intervention (EI) programmes in Jordan, namely the perspective on disability from an Islamic Arabic culture. The aim is to examine the perspectives of Jordanian parents and occupational therapists on the influence of their cultural understanding of disability on the provision and use of EI programmes. A qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with seven parents of children with disabilities using EI programmes, and five EI occupational therapists was used. The results provide an insight into the Jordanian cultural perception of disability which includes three themes: 'It is the will of Allah', 'Social stigma', and 'Extended family role'. The resulting themes coincide with the general Islamic Arabic perspective revealed in previous literature, with emphasis on the direct impact of the parents' cultural views on their involvement in their child's intervention. This is an important contribution to the limited literature on the cultural and religious view of parents on EI programmes within Islamic Arabic countries.

AB  - This study aims to examine the effects of electronic games on students' academic achievement. The study was conducted on a sample of parents in the city of Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. A questionnaire was used for data collection, with a sample of 76 parents randomly chosen, comprising 64 females (84.2%) and 12 males (15.8%). The study findings revealed that most students who preferred adventure games used electronic games on weekends for entertainment. However, excessive usage of these games had a negative impact on their academic achievement. Games tend to consume students' time, which in turn, affects their achievement. Based on the study results, the researchers recommended raising awareness among families regarding the risks of electronic games for children and their effects on their academic achievement through workshops, lectures, and seminars. Further research studies should be conducted to highlight the effects of electronic games on students' academic achievement from the perspectives of students themselves and their teachers.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of one mother's experience of engaging with her children's schools after leaving a long-term relationship characterised by years of family violence perpetrated by the children's father. We interviewed Bernadette as part of an ongoing study of parents' experiences of school engagement during family separation and divorce. Her family circumstances and the role the children's schools played in that story merit consideration by educators, school leaders and education policy makers. Informed by theories of everyday cultural practices and sociological studies of gendered power relations in education, we argue that gender politics and organisational strategies for keeping parents 'in their place' can significantly contribute to systemic failures and school cultures that reinscribe the effects of family violence.

AB  - Parents of children with hearing loss (HL) often navigate an unfamiliar and uncertain path. This qualitative study investigated the nature of parental uncertainty: (1) immediately after a child's HL was identified; (2) prior to primary school entry; and (3) during primary school. Open-ended questions in online surveys were completed by participants (N = 61) with: (a) personal experience as a parent of a child with HL (n = 35); (b) professional experience with children who have HL (n = 19); or (c) a combination of both parental and professional experience (n = 7). Six major themes were abstracted using thematic analysis, including uncertainty about: (1) the Pervasive Impact of HL, (2) the Nature and Causes of HL, (3) Developmental Impacts, (4) Family Life, (5) Family Decision-Making, and (6) Education and Support Services. The salience of these depended on the stage in time following identification.

AB  - This descriptive survey study investigates the perceptions of families with special needs children regarding the teachers, school communication and cooperation in terms of teachers' sex, age, education, professional formation, and experience. 276 parents whose children benefit from special education services in a special education and rehabilitation center in Sariyer district of Istanbul province participated to the study. Demographic information form and family-teacher communication and cooperation scale were employed to gather data. Findings revealed that the teacher-school communication and expectations of families with special needs children were quite high. Their perception of cooperating with the teacher was also high, while their participation in "communication and cooperation" was found to be at a medium level. In the study, significant differences were obtained in terms of communication, expectations, and collaborations with teachers' age, gender, occupation, and parents' marital status. Moreover, as the parents' education level increased, their perceptions and opinions regarding school-teacher communication and cooperation demonstrated more positive distribution. It was revealed that parents whose monthly household income was 5000 TL and below had higher and positive views towards family-teacher communication. Lastly, significant and positive relationships were found among parents' family-teacher communication, cooperation, expectations, and participation.

AB  - The present study examined the mechanisms by which family environment, parent--grandparent coparenting, effortful control, and early child-care experiences influenced young children's social adaptation in the Chinese context. A sample of 315 mothers of 2-3-year-olds (M = 33.36 months; SD = 5.10) in Beijing, China completed questionnaires to report children's temperament, family process, and children's social adaptation. Using the approach of conditional process analysis, the results revealed moderated mediation models that children's effortful control had a mediating effect on the association between their family process and social adaptation, while the effect of effortful control on social adaptation was contingent on children's early child-care experiences, with a stronger positive effect of effortful control among children who engaged for longer periods of child-care experiences. Findings point to the importance of understanding the role of family process and children's effortful control in the early development of social adaptation.

AB  - There is now international consensus that building positive partnerships between home and school is critically important for children's learning. However, the notion of family-school 'partnership' remains a vexed issue in education in Australia, with a persistent gap between the rhetoric/rationale for partnership and the lived experience of relationships that are the linchpin of effective and respectful practice. This gap may be amplified for some students and their families, particularly those who are marginalised, excluded or 'at risk' in some way, including those who are socio-economically disadvantaged. This paper draws upon data from the qualitative phase of a study focused on improving educational outcomes for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This phase included interviews with the parents/carers of 32 students and generated insights into the nuanced nature of family-school partnership for many of these families. The findings highlight the need for schools to recognise partnership efforts initiated by parents/carers, the value of consistent, informed practice, and the importance of working productively with the tensions that can exist around different perceptions and experiences that might otherwise reinforce disadvantage.

AB  - Family Drug and Alcohol Courts (FDAC) were introduced to England in 2008 following their development in the USA. Pilots launched across the country adopted a family-based strategy with the aim to improve outcomes for children that live with parents who misuse substances or alcohol. The numbers of children entering the care system has increased with 'subsequent new borns' being a particular concern frequently becoming 'looked after' by the state at birth. This article will focus upon an initial phase of a study that tracked the establishment of an FDAC pilot. It reveals how the FDAC team collaborated with Judges and a diversity of professionals and parents to create conditions through which ground-breaking practice was forged. The environment created is unique as it is one fully set within the context of each family's lived experience. Through this approach parents have become full participants in court proceedings as opposed to purely subject to them. As a result, significant numbers of children have remained with or been returned to their families.

AB  - In this paper, the authors seek to analyze the perceptions, motivations and experiences of young women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education projects aiming to incentivize gender equity, based on the theoretical framework of feminist studies on science and intersectionality, as well as academic literature on equity and inclusion in science communication. The following question was considered: How does experience in these projects influence young women's perceptions of belonging in the STEM fields? Working from a qualitative, content analysis approach, the authors conducted 73 questionnaires, 20 interviews, and 4 focus groups with 25 young women who participated in 4 projects developed in public schools in low-income settings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The authors categorized the experience of these young women in their "individual dimension"--regarding motivations, interests, science identity and future career prospects; "family dimension"--encouragement and recognition from family members and parents' beliefs and expectations; "educational dimension"--recognition by the school community, improvement in school performance, and intervention in school spaces; "project dimension"--representativeness of gender, race, class, and location, development of self-esteem and self-confidence, building of a sense of belonging, and active learning methodologies; and "social dimension"--domestic work in their daily lives and experiences of discrimination based on gender, race, class and location. The authors argue that such projects become "counter-spaces" in which marginalized young women find spaces of resistance and possibility, based on the unique position they occupy and, through feeling included and belonging, can claim their rightful presence from an intersectional perspective.

AB  - The influence of the family on its members is significant. Parents impart professional values and priorities that shape the perspective and often career choice of their children. Drawing on Family Systems Theory, this case study focuses on how the teaching profession connects and impacts one geographically dispersed, multigenerational family. Findings suggest that teaching connects family members through service to others, shared family values, early influences, identity construction, tradition, and even rebellion. Family members are proud of their fellow teachers, and of the younger generations for continuing the family 'business'.

AB  - Over the past few years, research has shown that stakeholders involved in CLIL develop positive views and attitudes alongside with higher motivation towards the foreign language (Czura, A., K. Papaja, and M. Urbaniak. 2009. Bilingual education and the emergence of CLIL in Poland. In "CLIL Practice: Perspectives from the Field," ed. D. Marsh, P. Mehisto, D. Wolff, R. Aliaga, T. Asikainen, M.J. Frigols-Martín, S. Hughes, and G. Langé, 172-178. Finland: University of Jyväskylä; Doiz, A., D. Lasagabaster, and J. M Sierra. 2014. CLIL and motivation: the effect of individual and contextual variables. "Language Learning Journal" 42, no. 2: 209-224; Pladevall-Ballester, E. 2015. Exploring primary school CLIL perceptions in Catalonia: students', teachers' and parents' opinions and expectations. "International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism" 18, no. 1: 45-59). Although there is plenty of literature dealing with teachers' perceptions, there does, however, seem to be a need for research (1) addressing families' and students' attitudes and motivations, and (2) stretching over time. Of the few existing longitudinal studies, the one conducted by Lasagabaster and Doiz's (2017. A longitudinal study on the impact of CLIL on affective factors. "Applied Linguistics" 38: 688-712) suggested that motivation towards the foreign language might not be sustained in the long term. This article encompasses a two-year longitudinal quantitative study on two groups of students (n = 20 and n = 24) and their families (n = 20 and n = 24). It deals with stakeholders' attitudes and motivations towards language learning within a multilingual CLIL environment, a medium-sized rural high school in Galicia (Northern Spain). The findings reported show that both CLIL and non-CLIL students as well as their parents developed long-term positive attitudes and motivation towards language learning, although CLIL students and their parents improved their attitudes to a greater extent.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic forced many Individualized Education Program (IEP) teams to hold virtual IEP meetings for students with disabilities instead of conducting them in person. Prior to the pandemic, research explored school professionals' and parents' perceptions of the IEP meeting experience in the context of in-person meetings. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how IEP meeting experiences changed for parents and school professionals as a result of the transition to virtual meeting collaboration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten school professionals and nine parents from two public school districts in the United States participated in semi-structured interviews about their perceptions of the IEP meeting experience before and after this transition. Six themes emerged from the analysis: (1) prioritizing preparedness; (2) conquering technology; (3) negotiating new communication norms; (4) building rapport; (5) adapting to a new kind of collaboration; and (6) harnessing flexibility. Findings identified challenges faced while preparing for and conducting virtual IEP meetings as well as opportunities to leverage virtual collaboration to improve the IEP meeting experience for school professionals and families of students with disabilities.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to better understand the phenomenon of exploring early mathematics through book reading. The study centers on Head Start and lays on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological framework). Two sub-questions guided the qualitative single case study of six Head Start adult participants (teachers, parents, administrators): (1) What are Head Start participants' experiences in exploring early mathematics through picturebooks? and (2) What do Head Start participants say about exploring early mathematics through picturebooks? Findings showed that participants expressed interest toward exploring early mathematics through picturebooks. Picturebooks were commonly used in the classroom but also accessible for families. Participants provided evidence of mathematics practices and discussions around mathematics in the school and in the home. The participants' sayings and experiences in exploring early mathematics through picturebooks aligned with child development and contexts of learning, two cornerstones of Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), but potential obstacles emerged. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

AB  - The challenges faced by parents raising children with cerebral palsy (CP) have been well explored in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the experiences of parents raising children with CP in low-income countries, such as Ghana. Objective: Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore parents' experiences of raising children with CP, specifically focusing on the relationships between spouses and between children with CP and their typically developing siblings. Method: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 parents, who were purposively selected from the largest tertiary hospital in Ghana. Results: The results revealed that typically developing children accept their siblings with CP as their equals and even take up domestic responsibilities to lessen the burden on their parents. However, the parents reported experiencing marital and extended family conflict, financial burden and negative attitudes from spouses, resulting in family tensions. Conclusion: The implications of these findings for policy-making have also been discussed.

AB  - There is limited evidence on family reintegration for children who have been in residential care within the African context. The goal of this study is to find out what factors impact reintegrated institutionalized children's desire to remain with their biological parents or extended family. The dataset included records for 659 interviewed children and their guardians. However, the analyses were limited to 408 cases with complete data on the dependent and independent variables. Most of the children in the study (73%) preferred to remain with their relatives. The age of the child, length of time spent in residential care, and having a case file, were all factors linked to the children's wish to stay with their family. Based on the findings of the study, social workers should do a full assessment and documentation to decide if reintegration is appropriate, prepare the child and family, and give follow-up assistance to ensure stable reintegration. Social workers must also link reunified families to long-term support such as enrollment on the Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty social protection program, and they should monitor placements to improve the stability of the reintegration.

AB  - In Manitoba, more than half of marriages end with divorce. Many of these families include children. This article addresses the need for school counsellors to understand the impact that divorce has on children's lives. Children require a method to deal with unresolved feelings related to divorce. A school counsellor can support children through the separation process by examining how divorcing parents' decisions disrupt the family system, understanding how children progress through the post-divorce developmental tasks, and exploring possible therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Families have been getting more and more involved in their children's education. This paper presents findings of a study investigating family involvement in their members' undergraduate studies attending a state (non-fee-paying) and a private (fee-paying) university in Cyprus. The data presented in the paper were collected via online logs completed by administrative personnel in the two universities documenting incidents of family involvement. The data analysis demonstrates how similarly the phenomenon manifests in both universities and suggests that where the two universities differ is more in the intensity of the various modes of family involvement. It also projects students' desires and encouragement of their family's involvement and their families' intervention to protect or guide them. The findings of the study are discussed in view of cultural and societal norms and changes about parenthood and the relationship between families and their university age members in a marketized higher education context.

AB  - In a radically changed and still changing world, parents, schools and pupils have had to adapt to a new teaching and learning modality. Working parents have faced the competing demands of employment and home-schooling, and schools provided support to pupils through online platforms and other resources. A qualitative approach elicited the views and experiences of working parents through a social media parents' group in Northern Ireland (NI). Only well-educated mothers responded revealing their extreme lack of confidence and pedagogical skills, complete exhaustion, frayed family relationships, and acute concern about children's educational loss and its future implications, particularly those for whom public examinations were imminent. Communication between teachers and both pupils and parents was deemed crucial, as were greater clarity from teachers on tasks set, less screen time, daily live interaction, feedback on work done, and more printed resources from schools to avoid undue expense for parents, especially those with children of different ages in different education sectors. Much more effective home-schooling could be facilitated if government required employers to arrange flexible working hours, at least for one parent. However, the creation of a daily structure that included lessons and leisure, the latter both indoors and outdoors, was beneficial and therapeutic.

AB  - In this article we describe evolving educational aspirations and practices of female high school students and their families in the context of rapidly changing education and employment markets in Kolkata. We interviewed 35 families of girls attending two government high schools. The families are from lower middle-class and lower income backgrounds. The latter see access to education as a way towards upward social mobility. Using gender and social class as axes of analysis, we explore how these families negotiate educational aspirations and practices in connection with married life and motherhood. We also look at the influence of social, cultural, and economic capitals on the formation of aspirations, knowledge about careers, and the ability to put aspirations into practice. This work contributes to the domain of research on education and social class in India with a gendered perspective and a unique setting in government high schools for girls.

AB  - Successful school transition is a basis for career development and eventual overall adult educational and socio-economic outcomes. Transitioning through primary school grades is a combination of relative academic and social skills acquired in each grade and forms the basis for subsequent academic and social success at ensuing educational pursuit and adult independent life. Evidence indicates that learners with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families experience limiting challenges in their school transition at different levels. There is a gap in the literature as to the specific factors that constitute school transition difficulties in primary school learners with ASD in the area of study. The purpose of this study was to investigate challenges that learners with ASD face as they transition through school grades. The study adopted a phenomenological design with 12 participants (6 parents and 6 teachers). Two focus group discussions were held to collect data analysed using inductive thematic analysis. The results revealed three main themes, which included poor academic achievement and skills development, social and economic challenges as well as behavioural problems. The findings of the study suggest an increased need for home-school collaboration during the early stages and throughout the school years for the effective transition of learners with ASD. Thus, providing learners with ASD and their families with academic, emotional and behavioural intervention and support can help learners with autism to develop personal resources that will encourage their educational success.

AB  - Background: Quality early childhood education (ECE) sets the foundation for children's healthy development. Families make choices regarding the ECE options available to them, and families who desire smaller, more personal, flexible, and less expensive options, often select family child care (FCC) providers over center-based care. In addition, trending research in the United States indicates that there is a decline of FCC providers leading to a gap in the available resources for families. Objective: This study explored the experiences of family child care providers regarding the challenges and benefits of their profession. Methods: Two focus groups (N = 27) comprised of licensed and unlicensed FCC providers were conducted to understand their perspectives on the perceived challenges and benefits of their work. Results: Using Bromer and Korfmacher's conceptual model of high-quality support, we conducted a thematic analysis and found providers identified several challenges including: feeling uncomfortable in their home, payment and scheduling issues, frustration with parents, limited resources, and role conflicts. Providers also described strategies for managing their family childcare program including utilizing critical early childhood education learning strategies with children, separating personal and work spaces, using contracts, and the importance of networking with other professionals. Providers also shared benefits of FCC for the children in their care, themselves, and their own families. Conclusions: The findings align with Bromer and Korfmacher's (2017) conceptual model and suggest a need for networking opportunities to provide information and support amongst FCC providers, improved resource sharing, more accessible funding opportunities, and the need for business training tools.

AB  - Fathers in families with childhood disability have an important role in fostering coping and resilience in children. Insight into men's thoughts about fathering is necessary to provide family-centered interventions. The purpose of this study was to explore men's experience of being a father in families with childhood disability. Qualitative interviews were conducted with seven fathers in families with childhood disability. Content analysis was applied to analyze the data. The participants described their thoughts about children's needs; mastery, secure attachment, clear boundaries, positive emotions, and role models. Creating a father-child unity, being active, playful, fearless, and sometimes restraint was described as fathering behaviors aiming to meet these needs. However, personal, family, and social factors were described as influencing fathers' behaviors. Fathers' psychological wellbeing was described to be affected by the childhood disability to different degrees, and emotional triggers related to the disability were described. Participants described using a variety of emotion regulation strategies, but somewhat restraint support seeking behavior. We conclude that the health and social welfare system should involve fathers in the provision of services to children, empower them in their role as fathers, and provide support tailored to their needs.

AB  - In the context of German linguistic policies, Heritage Language (HL) education ranges from formal and informal to non-formal offers. Families with migratory backgrounds seeking acquisition and maintenance of the HL frequently resort to educational or maintenance opportunities that are not institutionalized. In the region of Bavaria (Germany), the geographical context of this study, the teaching of Portuguese as an HL (PHL) mainly occurs in non-formal and informal educational spaces. The present empirical study follows an ethnographic perspective and examines how learners' parents in such non-formal environments perceive their children's bilingualism. As a secondary focus, the linguistic educational tool 'Mala de Herança' (MH) ("Heritage Suitcase" -- "free translation") shall be examined in order to assess its possible input in shaping the bilingual individual, following Van Lier's [2004. "The Ecology and Semiotics of Language Learning. A Sociocultural Perspective." Dordrecht: Springer.] ecological approach to language teaching. The data described in the study, obtained from parents' interviews, were collected through semi-structured interviews and interpreted through content analysis. Results point towards a very heterogeneous perception of the 'bilingual child' by the parents, compatible with the reviewed literature.

AB  - This study addresses children's Kyoiku (education) as it is explored by two kindergartens in Japan. It reports how the teachers, parents and children defined and experienced children's education and draws on the sociocultural concepts to understand their perspectives. Situated in the personal, educational, and sociocultural landscape of the educational environment, the analysis foregrounds a lens to identify the influences on children's education. The focus on children's education in this study enables the threads of different perspectives within the fabric of the kindergartens and Japanese contexts to be shared. The findings reveal that theorising about children's education invites scholarship that takes as axiomatic the complexity and distinctiveness of individual children, their families and the Japanese social and cultural dynamics.

AB  - There are racial/ethnic disparities in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, including delayed diagnosis, discrimination, and a lack of culturally responsive care. The perspectives of caregivers of color are critical in improving delivery of equitable care. We systematically reviewed articles pertaining to experiences with the diagnostic process among caregivers of color. We entered key terms into five databases to identify literature from 2000 to 2021. Fifteen qualitative studies met inclusion criteria, representing 253 caregivers. We used inductive methods to examine themes across racial and ethnic groups and assessed the quality of included studies. Families of color identified multiple factors that negatively affected the diagnostic process. Systems-level factors included long wait lists and financial concerns. Provider-level factors included minimization of caregiver concerns, a "wait and see" approach, biases, and lack of knowledge. Caregivers also described individual (e.g. knowledge) and family factors (e.g. stigma) that delayed diagnosis and complicated the diagnostic process. Communication barriers were commonly reported, which impeded understanding of autism spectrum disorder. Some families described providers, other individuals, community networks, and self-advocacy as facilitators. Interventions targeting systems- (e.g. Medicaid expansion) and provider-level (e.g. increase training in autism spectrum disorder) factors are needed to increase equity in the autism spectrum disorder diagnostic process.

AB  - Children who receive copious amounts of language stimulation from caring adults are likely to develop strong language skills, whereas children who receive limited language stimulation may experience delays. Little is known about the language stimulation strategies that families prefer to use. This mixed-methods study investigated families' preferences for, and use of, 10 specific language promotion strategies. Twenty-four families of infants slated to enter high-poverty schools or receiving Medicaid in the United States participated in a programme called Strong Beginnings for Babies. Three coaches worked with families in small group sessions focused on the strategies. Coach reports and parent ratings indicated there were strategies for which families expressed strongest preference, especially those involving music or chatting with their child. Furthermore, families used these strategies most often. Finally, coaches reported much evidence of family members talking, singing, and reading to their babies, even when a specific strategy of focus was not named.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) cluster within children. In addition to standardized ACE measures, there exist "ACE-related" measures that are either directly or indirectly related to the standardized ACE constructs. This study aimed to identify ACE-related latent classes of adolescents and describe past-month substance use in each class by sex and race/ethnicity. METHODS: Data from the 2018 Indiana Youth Survey (N = 70,703), which is a repeated self-administered, cross-sectional survey, were used. Latent class analysis was conducted using ACE-related family (parent incarceration, insulting/yelling within family, inability to discuss personal problems) and school (hate being in school, feeling unsafe, inability to talk to teachers one-on-one) items. Dependent variable combined past 30-day use-frequency of 17 substances. Two-way analysis of variances examined ACE by sex and race/ethnicity interaction. RESULTS: Four ACE-related classes emerged: "Family-Only" (11.2%), "School-Only" (16.5%), "Family-School" (8.0%), and "No-ACE" (64.3%). Substance use was highest in "Family-School" (mean = 0.67); lowest in "No-ACE" (mean = 0.21). Significant race/ethnicity (F = 27.06; p < 0.0001), ACE * sex interaction (F = 12.13; p < 0.0001) and ACE * race/ethnicity interaction (F = 4.57; p < 0.0001) effects emerged. Within each ACE-related class, substance use was lowest for Asians and highest for Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experience-related items cluster within children across school and family environments and clustering differs by race/ethnicity, but not by sex. Incorporating ACE-related items into school surveys enhances the ability to implement interventions that target relationships between ACEs and substance use.

AB  - Teacher-family partnerships are crucial elements of high-quality early childhood education. The factors influencing these partnerships, particularly for children under age 3, are not well known. This study compares teachers' and mothers' perspectives on their partnership and the ideal practices they would like to see implemented. Additionally, it investigates child, family, and program-level factors predictive of partnership practices. Participants were mothers and teachers of 90 infants who completed the Real-Ideal Teacher-parents Partnership Scale; mothers rated child's temperament, and classroom quality was observed 6-months after infants entered childcare. Home environment was assessed before infants entered childcare. Both mothers and teachers reported a medium-high number of practices being implemented, but ideally, would like more practices to be implemented. The frequency of mother and teacher reports of real and ideal practices were significantly associated, although teacher reports were higher. Findings from the regression analyses showed that teacher level of education (having a Master) was uniquely and positively associated with both teachers' and mothers' reports of real partnership practices, and was significantly associated with teachers' reports of ideal partnership practices. Mothers' education level predicted their ideal partnership practices. Findings highlight the importance of teacher education for partnerships, especially considering the variability in legal requirements regarding qualifications for teaching infants across Europe.
