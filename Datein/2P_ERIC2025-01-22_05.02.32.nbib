AB  - Students whose parents did not study at a university (first-generation students) exhibit differences in how they decide whether and what to study, compared to students whose parents attended university. In our study, we looked for possible similarities and differences between these two groups of students. The participants were Slovak students aged from 18 to 22 (N = 357). The data were collected using an online questionnaire. The results showed that it was significantly more important for second-generation students, whose parents had university degree experience, to continue the family tradition when deciding to study than for first-generation students. The results also revealed that the internet is the most important source of information for students when choosing the subject of their studies. At present, higher education institutions strongly compete for students and, consequently, we recommend that universities pay attention to different target groups of students and develop intervention programs aimed at retaining them. It is equally important that universities keep up with the times and provide relevant information on their websites in today's digital world.

AB  - The home environment and experiences before a child enters formal schooling have a significant impact on their educational progress and results. Most research in this area has been conducted in Western countries and may differ across different countries and cultures. The purpose of this study is to investigate how literacy skills are developed in Kazakh homes and the kinds of social interactions that take place between parents and children to foster this development. An ethnographic case study design through participant observations and interviews was used to further understand the relationship between the Kazakh home learning environment (HLE) and literacy development in four affluent and highly educated families. The findings of this study suggest that parent-child social interactions play an important role in the development of literacy skills in Kazakh families. The parents purposefully used play, joint book reading and storytelling to focus on oral language development and to establish skills in one language first despite the fact that Kazakhstan is a bilingual country that is gradually moving towards a trilingual policy (Kazakh, Russian and English). The study highlights the types of regular and high-quality literacy-related social interactions parents engage in to help their children succeed educationally in school and beyond. The findings of this study suggest that children would benefit from regular parent-child interactions and policymakers and other stakeholders responsible for early years learning and development should encourage parents to be actively involved in their children's learning and literacy development in the home environment.

AB  - This study explored whether parents' ability to regulate their behaviour and attention, assessed as components of everyday executive function (EF), was influenced by their past adverse experiences -- such as abuse, neglect, and family dysfunction -- and in turn, influenced current relationships with their children. The sample included 73 parent-child dyads from children enrolled in three Midwestern early childhood centres serving low-income children and families. Parents reported on their adverse childhood experiences, EF, and rated their relationship with their child. Findings indicate that more parental adverse childhood experiences were associated with higher ratings of parent-child conflict. This association was indirectly linked through parents' EF. Interventions aimed at parent-child relationships can benefit from addressing parents' past experiences and associated influences on parents' EF.

AB  - Families face systemic barriers when deciding on educational services for their children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Further, caregiver health and well-being is critical for supporting children with IDD. In addition, research has shown a negative correlation between the quality of special education experiences and caregiver health and well-being. However, the barriers and facilitators to positive special education experiences and health are unclear for Latino parents of children with IDD. By identifying barriers, interventions can be created to ameliorate such issues. By identifying facilitators, interventions can be developed to capitalize on the strengths of Latino families. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to positive special education experiences and health among Latino families of children with IDD. Via two systematic literature reviews, 28 studies were identified. Barriers to positive special education experiences included: cultural divergence, limited access to resources, stigma, and lack of access to special education knowledge; facilitators included: understanding special education services, parent-school communication, and parent support. Barriers to health included: socioeconomic status and certain characteristics of the child with IDD; facilitators included: family support and parent support. This review has implications for research and practice to both improve the quality of special education experiences as well as to promote caregiver health.

AB  - Disability-related services such as Early Childhood Intervention Services (ECIS) become a part of life for families when there is a child with disability. Many parents give up their everyday occupations such as self-care and paid work to be able to provide long-term caregiving. This Australian study explored parent perspectives of their family quality of life (FQOL) when there is a child with disability. It examined the relationships between ECIS, parent occupations and FQOL. A mixed-methods concurrent triangulation design was used. The Beach Center FQOL survey (N = 72) and 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted. There were high scores for overall satisfaction with Total FQOL and associations between FQOL, ECIS and parent occupations. The four themes highlighted that despite FQOL being fluctuating and challenging, positive adaptations (normalization) and positive beliefs helped FQOL. Parents were hopeful that their child would continue to progress in the future (stability). This study concluded that receiving family-centered and timely ECIS is positive for FQOL. While parenting was considered an important occupation, loss of previous occupations such as paid work and time for self-care had a detrimental influence on FQOL.

AB  - The overall purpose of this study was to examine parents' role in the development of character among young athletes, with a particular focus on life skills development across learning contexts (i.e., sport, family, school). Participants were 20 parents (13 mothers, 7 fathers, M[subscript age] = 46.8 years, SD = 4.6) and 24 children (14 girls, 10 boys, M[subscript age] = 14.3 years, SD = 1.3) who competed in a variety of youth sports. Each participant completed an individual semistructured interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. We identified five strategies that parents used to facilitate their children's life skills development: reinforcing values and consistency; giving perspective and guiding; seizing teachable moments; instructing, reminding, and encouraging; and promoting independence. These findings highlight parents' role in character development among young athletes, and show that life skills are developed and reinforced, across learning contexts.

AB  - Families including a young child with a significant cognitive and motor developmental delay need to adapt their routines to the child's needs, while balancing the resources, needs and values of the whole family system. We aim to characterize if and how their routines are sustainable in terms of ecological fit, congruence and meaningfulness, in comparison with families including a typically developing child. Based on an adapted version of the Ecocultural Family Interview, conducted with one or both parent(s), the routines of 6 families within the study group and 5 families within the control group were analysed by combining directed content analysis with quantitative ratings. A myriad of common as well as group-specific indicators of ecological fit, strategies for reaching congruence as well as reported family values were identified. Parents actively influence family life sustainability. However, families including a child with complex needs are more dependent on others and could benefit greatly from improving the organization of formal support.

AB  - Currently, little is known about the lived experiences of children who participate in yoga, particularly using their own words. This study provides insights into how young children aged 6 to 10 years old were able to understand their bodies within a yoga space. The purpose of this study was to investigate young children's lived experiences of yoga through qualitative interviews. Parents of children engaged in yoga were also interviewed to gain a sense of their point of view about the experiences of yoga for their children. Results indicated yoga had assisted children to find, and express joy, and fun by moving their bodies into different shapes. The physical and psychological difficulty of some of the yoga shapes assisted children to develop a persistent mind-set which enabled them to transfer knowledge to different contexts, such as difficulties at school, and finding ways to relax, and be with themselves. Yoga as an activity after-school develops strategies such as resilience, and assists in other contexts such as school, and family. The parents' described how they were looking for techniques to help calm their children, and how challenging this was with the constant stimulation of everyday activities. The findings suggest that yoga may have a place in the school curriculum for the purpose of teaching students' simple coping skills when experiencing feelings of stress, and anxiety, and assist with controlling their behavior.

AB  - "Parent involvement", valued by the field of early childhood education, is shown to contribute to the growth and development of children. However, what has in fact, been "valued" are engagement practices based on normalized white middle class cultural patterns. The current understandings of and expectations for "parent involvement" do not take into account the cultural patterns of Latino families as they determine and support the developmental and academic goals for their children. The findings of this study on the family engagement practices of Mexican immigrant families indicate that when research is grounded in a sociocultural framework, Latino families in a Head Start program fully engaged in their children's development and early education. Moreover, they did so by relying on their cultural values of: "respeto," "convivencia," "confianza," and "comunicación." The findings presented in this paper, a.) elucidate family engagement as a cultural practice, and b.) offer insights into how teacher preparation programs can support preservice teachers' awareness and understanding of diverse cultural patterns to strengthen the family-community-school relationship.

AB  - This study explores how Latin Jewish families navigate their intersecting identities as they make educational and other socialization choices for their children regarding heritage language and culture. Using a qualitative approach, the study focuses on six women, all mothers of young children living in San Francisco/Bay Area, who have chosen to transmit Jewish and Latin cultures and Spanish language to their children. Data analysis involved thematic coding and a grounded theory approach. The findings suggest that parents' (in this case, mothers') diasporic and minoritized cultural experiences play a large role in shaping their views, goals and practices for transmitting multiple diasporic cultures to their children. Understanding their choices offers Jewish educators and institutional leaders a critical view into better serving this Jewish demographic.

It involves surveying and analyzing data from interviews with parents of a Ukrainian private school. Findings highlight factors like child-centric approaches, fostering independence, and transparent school processes as crucial for parents. These trends, centered on returning to familiarity and building trust through transparent communication, offer guidance for other institutions in similar circumstances.

AB  - Background: There are multiple stakeholders involved in the introduction of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to children with complex communication needs. Stakeholders such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and teachers who are external to the family unit play a key role in planning and implementing interventions. If this intervention is unsuccessful, it can result in parent rejection or abandonment of the AAC system. However, no studies explore the contribution of external stakeholders to AAC rejection and abandonment from the perspective of parents who have experienced such unsuccessful interventions. Aims: To explore parents' perceptions of how external stakeholders may contribute to the rejection or abandonment of an AAC system. Methods & Procedures: Data were collected as a part of a larger study that explored parent experiences of AAC rejection and abandonment. Within this study, semi-structured interviews were completed with 12 parents who had rejected or abandoned an AAC system introduced to their child with complex communication needs. Data related to external stakeholder contributions were extracted from the interview transcripts, and a thematic analysis was conducted. Outcomes & Results: Analysis revealed four themes that captured the role of external stakeholders in the rejection and abandonment of AAC systems: (1) parents were influenced by the attitudes and experience of professionals; (2) parents did not feel supported by SLPs; (3) communication between stakeholders was not effective; and (4) parents had difficulties using AAC without a supportive community. Conclusions & Implications: This study highlights the importance of family-centred service delivery when introducing an AAC system to the parent of a child with complex communication needs. SLPs may support parent acceptance of AAC systems by using family-centred practices such as listening to parents, acknowledging their expertise and finding compromises.

AB  - As institutions across the country rushed to adjust to the realities of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, faculty parents were left to decipher how to manage childcare and their professional responsibilities while working remotely. Balancing work and home is a problem that has yet to be solved for working parents, especially working mothers. This study explores how cultural schemas and ideologies around work and family impacted how academic mothers adapted to the strains created by the COVID-19 shutdown in the spring of 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data from a novel survey was used to explore and analyze the gendered division of household labor and the professional impacts the pandemic had on faculty mothers. As predicted, faculty mothers experienced significant strain in balancing work and family, which was made worse by gendered divisions of household tasks and care work.

AB  - Preschool is a particularly opportune time to introduce measures that promote parental school-based involvement, as this is when the initial contact with the school is made. In Québec, a French-speaking province in Canada, voluntary school-based preschools for 4-year-olds have been offered to families in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. A component for parents comprised of 10 activities was developed specifically to promote parent involvement from the beginning of their child's schooling. However, some parents are more likely than others to encounter barriers that curtail their participation in these activities. Seventeen teachers working in preschools for 4-year-olds in targeted areas and 25 of their parents participated in this qualitative study. The study's objective was to identify the barriers to participation among parents whose involvement in school activities during the school year was low. Based on Hornby and Lafaele's conceptual model, a phronetic iterative analysis was used to describe the experiences reported by teachers and parents. Finally, the four main findings emerging from this study were formulated, and avenues for reflection by school-based preschool personnel were put forward.

AB  - Despite a recent increase in the number of studies examining diversity in a contemporary society in relation to gender/sexuality, family, culture, and bilingualism; no study has investigated the intersections of these four areas. The current study discusses the results of an empirical study that explored how discussions about books depicting same-sex parents help bilingual kindergarteners of Mexican descent understand gender non-conforming families, situating it within different theoretical perspectives including critical literacy and sociocultural perspectives. Based on qualitative data gained from a parent survey, teacher interviews, and classroom observations, the findings showed that discussions about books depicting non-heterosexual families provided the bilingual children in the focal classroom with a valuable opportunity to learn about family diversity and gender fluidity. This study offers implications for practitioners in early childhood and bilingual classrooms.

AB  - Family-focused early learning programs aim to assist parents in supporting their young children language and literacy development. This study examined program access and learning opportunities for diverse families across a wide range of community-based settings in one eastern Canadian province. As well, the study examined practitioners' perspectives on issues related to program development and implementation. Primarily through surveys, practitioners provided data on more half of all community-based programs in the province. The findings of the study showed that most programs offered a form of parent and child focused drop-in play as the core of their programing. Few programs offered a more formalized parent-facilitator learning component as is sometimes found in other jurisdictions. The issues and challenges in programing identified by practitioners included attracting participants, maintaining funding and expanding program activities, and staff training to expand and enhance programing to meet the needs of families. These issues are discussed in light of current public policy and practice.

AB  - The present study investigated parents' experiences in making educational decisions for their children with autism and their satisfaction with said outcomes. Parents completed a survey describing (a) their input in educational decisions, (b) satisfaction with school personnel, and (c) satisfaction with their child's school experience. Sequential regressions revealed parents' satisfaction was generally predicted by their own knowledge of autism, school staff knowledge of autism, parent satisfaction with teachers, and parent relationships with school personnel. In addition, parent input was a significant predictor of satisfaction with their child's school experience. Finally, open-ended responses indicated that parents experienced many barriers when working with schools and often felt compelled to go outside of the school system to ensure their children received an appropriate education. Implications for teacher preparation and school--parent partnerships are described.

AB  - In post-Soviet Kazakhstan, the system of care for children with autism has been transforming over the past three decades. There is little known about the use of complementary and alternative medicine by families raising autistic children in the post-Soviet region. An exploratory qualitative focus group design was employed to study parents' experiences of using complementary and alternative medicine focusing on the perceived factors driving the utilization of complementary and alternative medicine by families of autistic children and the availability of complementary and alternative medicine. Six focus groups were conducted in five cities of diverse geographical locations in Kazakhstan. Data were analyzed using a framework analysis. Two overarching themes and subthemes are developed. The first "unmet needs" relates to predisposing factors that motivate parents to complementary and alternative medicine uptake and the second "chasing hope" relates to enabling factors that facilitate parents' uptake of complementary and alternative medicines. In summary, parents of autism spectrum disorder children in Kazakhstan face multiple challenges when seeking treatment for their children's condition and implement whatever complementary and alternative medicine interventions available. A decision to use, and the choice of intervention, mainly comes from perceptions of having no other choice rather than from rational decisions based on efficacy of complementary and alternative medicines. This study provides the first empirical conceptualization of parents' motives for choosing complementary and alternative medicine in Kazakhstan.

AB  - Effective peer interaction is fundamental to social development, cognitive development, and academic success. Young children's early exposure to and development of social competence begins in the home and is further developed upon entry into early childhood programmes. In the United States, where early childhood programmes serve increasingly diverse families, discrepancies between families and teachers in relation to the social competencies valued may exist. This study compares parent and teacher perspectives of children's social competence (i.e. social skills and problem behaviours) and whether similarities and differences in perspectives are associated with children's classification as an emergent bilingual or monolingual native English speaker. Findings indicate statistically significant differences in parent and teacher ratings on the empathy, externalizing, and hyperactivity subscales for bilingual children and on the empathy, self-control, internalizing, externalizing, and hyperactivity subscales for monolingual English-speaking children. Recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Many scholars assert that current parent education practices in Hong Kong are dominated by the transmission perspective. This perspective assumes inadequacies in the knowledge and skills of parents; hence, the goal of parent education appears to be the transmission of facts as well as skills development and values information that prepare children to become better members of society. Simply providing parents with knowledge about child development and teaching them certain skills cannot help them gain deeper insights. Indeed, parents find it difficult to apply what they have learned because of inadequate reflections on their goals and values related to parenthood. These criticisms have serious implications on the re-conceptualization of parent education. This article reports on a new approach to parent education, in which a group of parent leaders developed and facilitated a group parent education program (GPEP) for low-income parents. The GPEP emphasized the use of the group approach and interactive activities as well as homework to help the target parents practice the skills they learned during the program. The parent leaders taught positive parenting strategies and exchanged their own experiences with low-income parents. This research aims to study how parent leaders evaluate their challenges, growth, and development, as well as analyze the impact of the GPEP approach on these parents. The study provides valuable data to facilitate further studies on GPEP and other alternative approaches for parent education.

AB  - This interpretive qualitative study of 17 first-generation college students (FGCSs) in the U.S. uses parent-generated familial capital as an asset-based framework to recognize the various ways that parents contribute to their undergraduate students' career development. Six themes illustrate parental contributions: facilitating students' access to pre-college educational opportunity, making financial contributions, instilling careerrelated values, giving career advice, job choice from parent contexts (or the way that knowledge of parent cultures and regions of origin informed career goals, especially for immigrant participants), and giving back to parents as a source of motivation for achievement and financial success. Findings also acknowledge the importance of considering FGCSs' multiple social identities, namely immigrant status, as the majority of study participants are from immigrant families, in understanding participants' career development experiences.

AB  - Purpose--This study aims to explore the missing learning phenomenon due to school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic in preschool settings from teachers' perspectives in Selangor, Malaysia. Related studies have shown that missing learning phenomena from different settings leads to delayed literacy development and raises the risk of dropping out among children. There is a lack of in-depth documentation on the missing learning phenomenon among preschoolers exploring the socioecology of preschool settings in a local context. Methodology--This research employed a case study approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with six preschool teachers from Selangor, Malaysia, using an inductive approach for a holistic understanding of the missing learning phenomenon during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were analyzed using Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS), NVivo version 12 software, which mapped the findings to understand further the ecosystem behind the preschoolers' absence of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings--Three major themes were revealed from the data: the missing learning demographic, socioecological factors, and mitigation plans. Several sub-themes (the compensative learning solutions, the demographic of impacted people, the delayed progress, teachers' readiness to facilitate online learning, engagement towards online learning, revised syllabus, personalized learning, and parental involvement) are classified under the respective major themes. Several main categories also emerged from the themes: lack of experiences and technology-pedagogical knowledge, unavailable online modules, low readiness to utilize online learning, unsupportive family climate, and accessibility. Learning intervention and online engagement with pupils during the pandemic are crucial in ensuring a successful continuous education. Significance--There is also a need for comprehensive remote instructional modules that consider socioecological actors -- parents and home climate; in the future and the enhanced instructional technology competency among preschool teachers.

AB  - Currently, there is limited research that centers the voices of youth of Color and their families living and attending school in rural communities in the United States. This lack of representation is even more prominent among rural youth who identify in culturally, racially, and linguistically diverse ways and who reside and attend schools in predominantly white contexts. This qualitative case study sought to explore the experiences of parents of children who identify as youth of Color and who reside or attend school in predominantly white, rural settings. Drawing from in-depth interviews with five parents from four families, findings reveal that same-race biological parents and transracial adoptive (TRA) parents enact multiple forms of cultural capital as they navigate their communities and their children's schooling experiences within a broader culture and climate of onlyness. Additional findings indicate the critical need for culturally competent and sustaining practices in predominantly white, rural schools

AB  - Increasingly, families know prenatally of certain diagnoses with a high probability of developmental delays. These diagnoses could result in eligibility for Part C early intervention (EI) postnatally. Although prenatal developmental interventions (e.g., Early Head Start, Nurse Family Partnership) are common for families with environmental risks, no research has explored the potential of prenatal EI for those families with EI eligible diagnoses. This online survey research explored family and practitioner perspectives of potential prenatal EI and project-identified prenatal outcomes (i.e., health and well-being, parent-child interactions, parenting to family culture, and navigating systems and supports). Overall, both samples reported the prenatal outcomes were clear and important prenatally. Families preferred EI practitioners help with all outcomes. Practitioners preferred to take the lead on some outcomes (e.g., knowledge of and comfort with EI services, intention of EI), whereas the medical community took the lead on others. Findings support the need for further research on the potential of prenatal EI and resulted in implications for current postnatal EI.

AB  - Background and Aims: The coronavirus pandemic (CP) leading to prolonged lockdown, and restriction of movement for almost two years in Bangladesh severely affected not only the well-being (physical and mental health) of both children and adults but also their access to home-based learning. The present study aimed to explore the mental, and physical health problems of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), their use of telehealth services, and the status of their home-based learning by asking questions to their parents/primary caregivers (N = 149) during the second year of lockdown (November and December 2021). Methodology: The present study was a cross-sectional self-reported survey covering as many parents/primary caregivers as possible within Bangladesh. The survey questions were selected from a larger study by Masi "et al." named 'COVID-19 impact survey' with permission. A total of 149 parents/primary caregivers with one or more children (mean age = 5.54) having any of the NDDs took part in the survey. Data were collected via physical sitting, telephone interview, and anonymous Google form. Results: Almost one-third of parents/caregivers felt that the NDD symptoms of their children were worsening with time, and half of them reported that their children's health and well-being were negatively impacted. More than 90% of the caregivers felt that their children are facing challenges following the rules of social distancing. Whereas more than 80% of parents agreed that their children's learning was disrupted during COVID-19, and they were not getting enough online/offline support from the authorities. Conclusions: The outcome of this study suggested that CP had a significant impact on the well-being and home-based learning of children with NDDs and their families in Bangladesh. Most of the caregivers reported that the NDDs symptoms of their children are worsening with disrupted routine, facing problems following social distancing and maintaining fruitful relationships. In terms of home-based learning, most caregivers reported insufficient support from school authorities. The parents recommended the development of an adequate system for telehealth services and policies to help the vulnerable individuals in the future.

AB  - This study seeks to uncover the experiences of Indonesian mothers as they navigate the challenges of supporting their children's education. To achieve this, a total of eight participants, all of whom are highly educated with advanced degrees, were recruited from various university settings. This study aims to analyze and reflect on the experiences of individuals who have helped children with their learning at home. The focus is on using theme analysis to gain a deeper understanding of these experiences. The data was collected through interviews and Focus Group Discussions , and subsequently analyzed using thematic analysis. The results reveal that the mothers employ diverse strategies to support their children's learning, tailoring their approach to the child's educational level. They also engage other individuals, including fathers, grandmothers, older siblings, and tutors, in supporting their children's learning. However, the primary responsibility for aiding their children in their education lies solely with the mothers. The mothers face various challenges when it comes to supporting their children's learning, such as the need to fully grasp the subject matter, adeptly utilize technology, manage physical exhaustion, adapt to different teaching approaches, and find time for mentoring. These mothers are advocating for the enhancement of partnership programs between parents and schools, with the aim of fostering stronger relationships and collaboration.

AB  - The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of embedding the computer-based 'Parent, Family, and Community Engagement Simulation Series' within teacher education curricula in higher education institutions in the US and in Spain. A quantitative survey design was used to explore student teachers' perceptions of the simulation experience. The sample consisted of 95 undergraduate education students from Chicago State University (US) and Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain). Participants attended a session where they played a 21-34-minute simulation, and afterwards completed an online questionnaire. As a result of the study, it was found that the simulation helps students learn strategies to promote family engagement and deepen their knowledge to promote positive, goal-oriented relationships with families. Based on the results, it can be asserted that the simulation also supports student teachers' in-depth learning when practicing active listening skills and relationship-building strategies.

AB  - This study adopted a community-engaged approach to explore Korean parents' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing autism services in British Columbia, Canada. Understanding the experiences of culturally and linguistically diverse families and their children may help facilitate the development of more inclusive, appropriate, and culturally sensitive services. Semi-structured interviews with 20 Korean parents of autistic children were analyzed using a thematic approach. Barriers and facilitators at the system, provider, and family/cultural level were identified. Barriers at the system level included delays and waitlists for services, and ineffective school policies to address child behavioral challenges. At the provider level, barriers included a lack of qualified professionals, negative attitudes, and lack of guidance navigating services. For family/cultural-related barriers, language and communication difficulties, out-of-pocket costs, and stigma impeded service access. Facilitators at the system level included family-centered care and prioritization of mental health supports. At the provider level, strengths included culturally competent and bilingual professionals. The family/cultural-related facilitators identified were informal support networks, characteristics of the parent, and connections to cultural community organizations. The findings emphasize the need to understand and consider diverse experiences, preferences, and values in the design and provision of autism services for families and their children.

AB  - Background: Sweden is in transition when it comes to the immigrant experience. More research is needed to document the life circumstances and adjustment of those with foreign background living in Sweden. Objective: This study investigated the lived experiences of parents of youths and young people themselves who have an Iraqi or Syrian background and are living in Sweden. Method: This cross-sectional qualitative interview study focused on a sample of parents of youth and youth (N = 26) with a foreign background. Participants were either born in Syria or Iraq or had one or both parents born in these countries and had migrated to Sweden. Participant interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: In relation to the study aim, the analysis indicated three main themes in participants' responses which concerned life in Sweden, feeling at home, and coping. Conclusions: Overall, these themes reflected how the perception of everyday experiences relates to adjustment within a multi-cultural urban Swedish context. This study showed how participants with a foreign background are rich in their own diversity of experiences and viewpoints. Results also pointed towards the promise of social policy and services aimed at benefiting those with a foreign background if such efforts are situated in the microsystems that provide life daily structure, as well as in contexts that offer socialization and networking opportunities (e.g., training, education, work, and school). Further, such action should consider the importance of the extended family as part of family-focused initiatives.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to better understand parents' perspectives of education in Budapest, particularly parents of children with disabilities or children who struggle with learning. Nine parents were interviewed. Parents found schools for their child with a disability to be lacking in terms of updated materials, methods and service provision for students; relationships with families and the burden placed on families to advocate for their child or find alternatives were also problematic. Changes are required at all levels of the educational system, including parent involvement and teacher preparation programmes.

AB  - In this article, the authors analyze four picturebooks about adoption that highlight these experiences of liminality. Children who have been adopted may feel torn between two families and cultures. Children who are adopted must make sense of their lives and identities, residing in a state of in-between-ness. Adoption presents a time of displacement and a crossing over into something new. Critical adoption studies shifts the focus from the family formed through adoption to acknowledging the possible hardship and inequitable conditions the birthparents may experience through a trauma-informed approach. At the heart of critical adoption studies is an interrogation of the ways in which matters such as reproductive justice, choice, poverty, race, capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism all intersect to construct the complexity of adoption in which some are privileged and others marginalized. Another way critical adoption studies highlights injustice is by considering how adoption is operationalized to privilege white, heterosexual, cisgender couples who are often American and financially secure. One aspect of critical adoption studies that is especially important to consider in our study relates to the notion of kinship. The notion of kinship as a normative model of family is disrupted as an adopted child is introduced to a family, particularly when the adopted child is a different race than the adoptive parents, and thus subject to racism that the adoptive parents will not experience in the same way. At the same time, as the notion of kinship and biological belonging is disrupted, the "ideal family" is upheld, and notions of what this entails are reproduced (e.g., middle-class, Western ideals).

AB  - Families play a vital role in the development of the science interests and career aspirations of youth. Of particular interest is how a family's science capital and science habitus impact how children see themselves in relation to science. One aspect of science capital that has emerged as foundational in children's levels of science self-efficacy and academic self-concept is their access to science related tools outside of school. To learn more about the role of science tools in building the future science interests of youth, this exploratory study examined reported access to science-related tools and tool experiences for 89 participants (44 parents and 45 children). The results showed that more than half of the children reported a lack of home access to science tools such as a meter stick, compass, or scale. There were significant differences in reported access to science tools for African American and Latino/a youth. The reported access to tools for youth was significantly correlated with their science achievement value score (a measure of self-efficacy and self-concept). When comparing child and parent reported tool access, the parents noted having significantly more tools at home than the child participants. The findings from this study suggest that parents should provide opportunities for their children to explore these common household tools on their own as well as in family contexts. Having prior experiences with science tools outside of school is an important form of science capital that could foster success for children in the science classroom.

AB  - Mindfulness strategies can have a large impact on emotional regulation, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal relationships. Parents of children on the autism spectrum may experience greater stress, depression, and strained interpersonal relationships than those with typically developing children or those with children experiencing other developmental delays. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects of a virtual Mindful Self-Compassion workshop for parents of children on the autism spectrum and the impact on stress, self-compassion, parenting self-efficacy, and mindfulness. This pilot study used a mixed-method approach to test this hypothesis. Participants completed surveys before and after the brief workshop and participated in a 1-hr focus group within 1 week of completing the surveys. The findings indicate that a short, 3-day virtual workshop may be effective toward improving parents' mindfulness and self-compassion. Parents reported feeling more mindful in their day-to-day life, more self-compassionate during difficult times, and more patient with themselves and other people in their family. A brief, virtual workshop may be effective for short-term improvements in outcomes for parents of children on the autism spectrum.

AB  - To address disparities in post-school outcomes for students with disabilities, federal legislation mandates appropriate education programs to include transition planning and programs for students with disabilities. Because administrators are held responsible for ensuring appropriate educational programs for all learners including those with disabilities, it is important to understand their perspectives on secondary transition; however, research on administrators' involvement in secondary transition activities is limited. Using a single-state survey, this study examined the perspectives of secondary school administrators (i.e., principals and assistant principals) on their involvement and engagement in providing effective transition services for students with disabilities and their perceptions of barriers to providing and supporting transition efforts. Frequency of responses show the majority of administrators indicated they were highly involved in including parents and families in transition processes and attending IEP meetings. Yet, they were never directly involved with collaborating with community agencies to be actively involved with students with IEPs. Frequency of responses also show the majority of participants identified families not being prepared to participate in transition processes as a significant barrier as well as the absence of real-life instructional contexts (e.g., paid work experience) and lack of effective supports for students with IEPs from outside agencies as significant or moderate barriers. Implications for practice and future research are provided.

AB  - In this article, Sarah Gallo and Holly Link draw on a five-year ethnographic study of Latina/o immigrant children and their elementary schooling to examine the complexities of how children, teachers, and families in a Pennsylvania town navigate learning within a context of unprecedented deportations. Gallo and Link focus on the experiences and perspectives of one student, his teachers, and his parents to explore how his father's detainment and potential deportation affected his life and learning across educational contexts such as home, school, and alternative educational spaces. In attending to the ways that this student effectively developed and deployed his knowledge of immigration outside of his classroom spaces, the authors explore the possibilities and tensions of creating safe spaces for students to draw on immigration experiences for learning in school. Rather than maintaining silence around issues of difference like immigration, they call for educational practices and policies that will better prepare educators to recognize and respond to students' "politicized funds of knowledge," the experiences, knowledges, and skills young people deploy and develop across learning contexts that are often not incorporated into classroom settings.

AB  - Applying a socio-spatial perspective, this study examines the ethnoreligious identities of Turkish immigrant parents in Germany within home--school--society relational spaces. A total of 22 qualitative interviews with parents of children aged 3-6 years or 8-12 years were conducted and analyzed using content analysis. The findings show that parents construct a home space by adopting religious congruence with or separation from school and societal spaces based on their ethnoreligious identities. The inclusive or exclusive school and societal spaces reproduce each other and, in turn, shape parental identities that influence beliefs and practices related to ethnoreligious upbringing within the home space. Besides contributing to the spatial perspective in educational research, this study has implications for policy and practice.

AB  - Research on teaching mathematics to children with autism spectrum disorder using parents as mediators is limited. The purpose of the present study was to carry out an initial evaluation of an adapted numeracy programme with three children with autism spectrum disorder from Arabic families in the UK by training and supporting their parents to deliver the intervention over the course of an 8-week period. The three children's mathematical ability (on a standardised assessment) improved over the course of the intervention. Parents also described positive experiences of their training and of using the curriculum, especially mentioning how much their children had progressed in their understanding of mathematics. The study data show promising results and provide initial evidence that the adapted numeracy programme can be adapted for a home context and for teaching in Arabic.

AB  - Background: Heightened familial stress and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to increased negative parenting practices, particularly for parents with substantial adverse childhood experiences (ACES). Objective: To determine whether families' COVID-19-related distress is associated with young children's emotional/behavioral functioning via negative parenting, and whether these relationships vary based on parents' ACEs. Participants and Setting: Participants were 267 parents of children ages 1.5-5 years recruited from five primary care sites across the United States. Methods: Participants completed internet questionnaires including measures of demographics, parent ACES, negative parenting, parent mental health, and COVID-19 distress. We used regression analyses to test a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between COVID-19 distress and child emotional/behavioral problems is mediated by negative parenting, and both the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 distress on child emotional/behavioral problems is moderated by parents' ACEs. Results: Negative parenting significantly mediated the relationship between COVID-19 distress and child emotional/behavioral problems (indirect effect [beta]=0.07). Parents' ACEs moderated the associations between COVID-19 distress and both negative parenting and child emotional/behavioral problems, such that each relationship was stronger in the context of higher parental ACEs. The model accounted for 42% of the variance in child emotional/behavioral problems. Conclusions: Findings have implications for managing risk and promoting well-being in young children during periods of significant stress and routine disruption. This study advances understanding of factors influencing negative outcomes in children during the pandemic's acute phase and may have implications for the development of targeted interventions to improve families' adjustment in the future.

AB  - Background: Family-school connections during the transition from preschool to primary school are crucial, as they serve to bridge the gap between the home and school learning environments. In order to support children's learning and engagement throughout their school career, more needs to be understood about the factors that contribute to successful or difficult transition experiences during this critical period. Purpose: This case study was part of the Children's School Lives (CSL) national longitudinal study of Irish primary schooling. It aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of mothers' experiences of family-school connectivity during their child's transition to primary school in Ireland, exploring how these connections helped them manage their experiences of the transition. Method: A qualitative, interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach was used to investigate mothers' experiences of the transition to primary school from preschool. The analysis drew on data collected from semi-structured interviews carried out with five mothers of children who had started primary school. Findings: Overall, findings from the analysis suggested that mothers had positive experiences of family-school connectivity during the transition period and indicated high levels of trust in their children's teachers and their abilities. Mothers expressed a desire to be active participants in their child's learning and transition experience, as well as to develop quality connections with their child's school and teachers through regular communication and familiarity with the school environment. However, the analysis identified that experiences among the mothers were mixed. Conclusion: This study offers insight into the need to develop consistent policy and practice across schools in terms of opportunities to contact teachers, parent-school communication and transition activities held by schools. It highlights the importance of creating strong bridges between families and schools and positive transition experiences for children entering primary school.

AB  - Patient-oriented research engages patients and caregivers as partners contributing to all phases of the research process. This was the goal of the Strongest Families Institute Neurodevelopmental research, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, when they included a parent advisory committee, made up of parents and caregivers of children and adolescents with a neurodevelopmental condition, to complete their research project. The purpose of this qualitative research was to examine the experiences of researchers and parents of children with a neurodevelopmental condition who participated on a research study advisory committee for the Strongest Families Neurodevelopment research project. From interviews with both parents/caregivers and researchers that played a role on the advisory committee, four major themes emerged on how to negotiate and navigate their time on the committee and what worked well and what did not. This led to recommendations for future researchers and patients who may create or be a part of an advisory committee.

AB  - Childhood sibling relationships shape an individual's interactions throughout life. To date, there have been only a few studies on sibling relationships in families with gifted and non-gifted children, and these have yielded mixed results. Based on the Family Systems Theory (FST) as a conceptual framework, specifically the homeostasis principle, the current study explores how parents in families with gifted and non-gifted children affect sibling relationships. Interviews with 40 parents of gifted children in Israel revealed three higher-order themes: differential equity, artificial equity, and situational equity. From an FST perspective, results suggest a preliminary typology that describes the parental contribution toward rebalanced sibling relationships. Despite good intentions, using artificial and situational strategies could provide unfavorable results for the gifted and the non-gifted children. The proposed typology may contribute toward developing a systemic theory of sibling relationships.

AB  - This study investigated relationships among home reading practices, shared book reading (SBR) behaviors, and child literacy outcomes in young children with cochlear implants in Baltimore, Maryland. Parents (N=18) completed a home reading questionnaire and recorded themselves reading books with their children at home. Shared book reading sessions were coded for interactive reading behaviors. Children's early language skills and literacy skills were also assessed. We explored variability in these behaviors with regard to demographic characteristics and type of book; these exploratory analyses revealed that parents used more literacy teaching techniques when reading the wordless picture book and that parent interaction and engagement and literacy teaching techniques were more frequent with younger children than with older children. While many families frequently used interactive reading behaviors, our analysis did not find significant relationships between the parent behaviors and children's literacy scores. However, there was an interaction between the "amount" of reading and cochlear implant experience such that more cochlear implant experience was associated with better reading outcomes "only" for the group of children who received more reading time. In a sample of young children with cochlear implants, reading time, cochlear implant experience, and child language skills were better predictors of reading outcomes than parents' frequency of SBR behaviors alone.

AB  - Due to systemic barriers, Spanish-speaking (versus English-speaking) parents of children with disabilities are less likely to participate in educational decision-making. However, little research has directly compared special education experiences between both populations. The purpose of this study was to explore the differences and similarities between Spanish-speaking (n = 12) and English-speaking (n = 44) parents of children with disabilities. Specifically, six focus groups were conducted in either English or Spanish in two states. There were three main findings: exacerbated negative experiences (e.g., disempowerment and lack of teacher knowledge) for Spanish-speaking (versus English-speaking) parents, unique communication barriers among Spanish-speaking families and shared barriers among English- and Spanish-speaking parents. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Educational attainment is closely associated with health. The objective is to explore the extent to which children and adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) are afforded the same educational and socialization opportunities as their healthy peers. We used a qualitative phenomenological design with convenience sampling. Data gathered 27 semistructured interviews: children with CHD (n = 9), parents (n = 10), and professionals (n = 8) in Catalonia, Spain. Interview transcripts were coded using the constant comparative method and analyzed using ATLAS.ti software. The analysis revealed three themes describing the experience of schooling for children with CHD: (1) Empowering and enabling a child with CHD to achieve academically and engage socially is a challenge for parents; (2) Teachers lack the resources and specific skills necessary to meet the diversity needs of children with CHD; (3) Parents and teachers have low expectations regarding the academic achievement of a child with CHD. Further application of the constant comparison method yielded a core theme: (4) Children with CHD experience exclusion from peer group social learning activities. Further efforts are needed for more effective collaboration and coordination between educational and health professionals to provide support for teachers and families and enable children to be better integrated within schools.

AB  - The closure of schools and healthcare facilities across the United States due to COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way that services are provided to children with disabilities. Little is known about how children who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), their families and their service providers have been impacted by these changes. This qualitative study sought to understand the perspectives of parents and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) on how COVID-19 has affected children, families, services providers and the delivery of AAC-related communication services. For the study, 25 parents and 25 SLPs of children who used aided AAC participated in semi-structured interviews, with data analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Parents and SLPs highlighted wide disparities in how children have been impacted, ranging from views of children making more progress with communication and language than before the pandemic to worries about regression. A complex system of factors and processes may explain these differences. COVID-19 will have lasting impacts on the lives of children with complex communication needs. This research highlights the crucial role of family-service provider partnerships and access to quality AAC services for children during the pandemic and into the future.

AB  - Anxiety is a common co-occurring condition in autism and impacts quality of life of autistic individuals and their families; autistic individuals who speak few or no words represent an under-researched group. This qualitative study aimed to understand more about parental recognition and management of anxiety in autistic individuals who speak few or no words. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents/carers of 17 autistic individuals (m[subscript age] = 14.29) recruited from an existing participant database and social media adverts. Using thematic analysis, 15 themes were placed under three a-priori grand themes: parental recognition of anxiety; parental management of anxiety; and anxiety impact on the autistic individual and their family. Due to reduced verbal language use and overlap with other behaviours, parents described difficulties recognising anxiety in their child. However, they also described use of a number of management strategies, including some which overlap with components of evidence-based interventions for emotional and behavioural problems in autistic individuals (e.g. exposure/sensory calming). Despite this, parents reported that anxiety continues to have significant impact on quality of life. The findings of this study can help to inform the development of targeted intervention and assessment measures for anxiety in autistic individuals who speak few or no words.

AB  - Background: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) parents of children with developmental disabilities (DDs) in health and early learning systems are largely understudied. Inclusive, affirming services are critical to timely identification and intervention for DDs. This literature review aimed to establish whether LGBTQ parents experience structural bias and discrimination when accessing care for their children in health and early learning systems. Methods: PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus were searched for empirical research from 1990 to 2020 on: LGBTQ; parents, children, families; bias, disparities, discrimination; and health and early learning services. Themes were analyzed by conceptual model bias levels, participant type, and setting. Results: The search yielded 1,872 unduplicated records (three through hand search). Twenty-nine articles representing 26 studies in health and early learning in eight countries met the inclusion criteria. Biases common across sectors included challenges surrounding LGBTQ status disclosures; lack of acknowledgment of non-biological parents; and heterosexist forms. Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes about LGBTQ families were found among some professionals and students. Conclusion: Some LGBTQ parents experienced bias and discrimination while accessing care for their children in health and early learning systems. Policies and programs to implement and monitor LGBTQ-inclusive health education and evaluate practice changes are recommended to improve professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Multilevel workforce development (e.g., accreditation standards, organizational audits, and training) is needed to create and sustain LGBTQ-affirming health and education environments. Honoring LGBTQ family diversity and reducing health and early learning inequities are critical for improving children's health and education outcomes.

AB  - Parents are the key people in the family when it comes to determining the extent and type of education for their children. Within the theoretical frameworks of African feminisms, human capital theory, and the liminality theory, this paper examines the parental perceptions of the girls' secondary education in Tanzania's rural communities. Moreover, it determines the effects of those perceptions on the girls' secondary schooling in rural Tanzania. Using the ethnographic research design, this qualitative study found that, although some parents perceived girls' secondary education negatively, there were some glimmers of hope and changing attitudes among parents. The findings further indicate that there are tensions and conflicting perspectives, as some of the parents struggled to reconcile emerging beliefs about girls' education with the existing largely conservative cultural and familial practices. This changing perception on the girls' secondary education signals a favourable disposition towards the improvement of girls' secondary schooling, particularly in the largely conservative rural communities.

AB  - Despite the importance of family-centered practice in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part C, a federally funded program for birth to two-year-old children with disabilities, there is a lack of research on Asian families who participate in early intervention in the U.S. This study examined the experiences of two Korean families and one Chinese family in early intervention in the U.S. Interviews were conducted and analyzed by bilingual researchers using ecological systems theory. As a multiple-case design study, the caregiver roles, beliefs, practices, and experiences related to their participation in early intervention were reported through within-case and cross-case analysis.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the factors relating to school dropout from the perspective of dropout students, their teachers, and their parents. It also explores students' experiences after school dropout. To this end, in this qualitative study, five young adults who dropped out of middle or high school and their parents and teachers were interviewed. The study found the factors related to school dropout included adjustment problems at the individual level; family, teachers, and economy at the microsystem level; and gender at the macrosystem level. While students, teachers, and parents generally agreed on economic conditions, they had different views about family impact and teacher impact. The study also determined that individuals dropping out of school cannot enter the labor market due to school dropout or have to work in low-status jobs; they regret dropping out; and they think that they would have had a better life if they had not left school.

AB  - Previous studies have focused on how parental factors affect children's learning development. This study aims to review previous findings and explain the relationship between child literacy development and parenting in terms of two environmental factors: family socioeconomic status (SES) and parents' involvement based on positive role beliefs, especially when they have children in the early childhood and elementary years. Previous studies have found that children from lower SES families experience considerable disadvantages in their literacy development. However, other scholars argue that parental involvement based on positive role beliefs can meaningfully contribute to children's improved literacy outcomes. Also, multiple studies point out that parents' positive role beliefs can offset the disadvantages in children's literacy development caused by low SES. By comparing the findings of previous studies, this article provides a foundation for future research on familial issues in child education.

AB  - Prevention-focused parenting education programs (P-FPEPs) provide knowledge and support to parents to strengthen parent-child relationships, enhance parental and family well-being, and promote healthy child development. The positive impact of such programs on child health and development is well documented. Yet, how P-FPEPs influence parents remains unclear. The objective of this study was to explore parental perceptions of changes associated with participation in a P-FPEP. We analyzed data using interpretive description with qualitative responses from 459 parents who participated in nine different P-FPEPs in a large Canadian city. Participation in a P-FPEP changed parents' relationships with themselves, their children, their partners, and their community. Participants' relationship with themselves as parents changed as they recognized the value of self-care without guilt, gained knowledge of typical child development, and developed greater confidence in their parenting. Positive changes in participants' relationships with their children were facilitated by better understanding the perspective of the child, improving communication, feeling more connected to their child, and changing parenting behavior. For many participants, the relationship with their partner improved when they learned about different parenting styles and began communicating more openly. Participants' relationships with the larger community were strengthened as they experienced a sense of normalization of their parenting experiences, developed connections with other parents, and learned about community resources. Independent of any specific program curriculum or structure, change associated with P-FPEPs focused on how a shift in understanding and attitudes changed relationships and consequently changed parenting behavior.

AB  - Communication and literacy development of young children is shaped by the nature of social and cultural relationships in everyday situations. Few studies, however, have explored early story experiences encountered by infants and toddlers in naturalistic settings. We argue that personal stories about everyday lived experiences are a vital context for considering how toddlers develop communicative competencies as they participate in these stories within their families and communities. The paper presents selected findings from a qualitative study underpinned by a broad theoretical view of story embedded in a sociocultural, participatory framework. We contend that stories are collaborative, social endeavours in which intersubjectivity is accomplished collectively and multimodally. Evidence is offered of the communicative process enacted by 1-year-old Lexie, her parent, teacher and peers, as they shared meaning together in a personal story about eating lunch. Lexie and her family were participants in a wider study of the story experiences of 1-year-old toddlers, within and across their family home and early childhood settings, in a culturally diverse community of Aotearoa New Zealand. Drawing on multimodal ethnography and video data, findings illustrate how Lexie and her family, teacher and peers actively participated together in the weaving of a shared personal story using verbal, visual and kinaesthetic forms of communication. The study contributes to the field of early childhood literacy by providing unique insights into the potential of everyday personal stories as a valuable context for exploring ways children's communicative competencies are developed through relationships in family and community settings.

AB  - This study focuses on the relationship between parent's socioeconomic status and student's academic performance in different graduate and undergraduate programs offered by constituent colleges of Pokhara University. The total sample of the present study was 301 students who have been pursuing their respective academic degrees. The sampling design was based on a purposive convenient method. Structured questionnaire technique was used to obtain quantitative data related to parental socioeconomic status and academic performance of students. The results revealed that parental socioeconomic status and parent's level of education does not have a significant relationship with academic performance of students. However, the occupation of parents has a greater impact on academic performance of students. Moreover, the residence of the students has a significant impact on the academic performance of the students. The findings of the study also reveal that family financial status is more important determinant of school level academic grades, however, its influence in college level grades is relatively low. Although, parent's educational status is found to be associated with academic achievement, father's employment nature and family expenditure level were found to be the most significant determinants of academic achievement of students. However, the relationship is true only up to the school level academic performance.

AB  - This study looked at the experiences of six participants and their feelings of guilt. The findings revealed that guilt was caused when the participants put their needs before the needs of their family and attended college. Institutions of higher education may not know or understand the importance family plays for these students and may not foster parent participation, therefore potentially increasing these feelings of guilt.

AB  - The success of all school-age children relies heavily on active engagement between caregivers and school communities (Francis et al., 2016). Meaningful parent-school partnerships involve reciprocal relationships that build on each other's expertise and are based on good communication, professional competence, advocacy, commitment, equality, and trust (Kyzar, Haines, Turnbull, & Summers, 2017). However, many African Americans struggle with school partnerships (Latunde & Clark-Louque, 2016; Williams, Pemberton, & Dyce, 2012). In special education, family-school partnership is particularly important and is mandated by federal law as part of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 2004 because of the need for shared decisions on the child's educational goals, services, and placement. This research aimed to build on the existing literature by gaining a deeper understanding of the experiences of African American parents of children on the autism spectrum within their families and communities and their experiences and needs while navigating school communities. This study reiterates the necessity for schools and district staff to improve efforts to build trust, increase representation, and acknowledge the impact of turning a blind eye to inequality and cultural unawareness for this demographic of parents and students. Increasing awareness about autism in the African American community and in schools, involving cultural brokers, creating communities of practice, and practicing cultural humility are ways of ensuring quality and equality for students with autism in educational settings.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore young children's information practices within the context of their individual interests, examining children's interest-related information activities, challenges encountered and enablers received. Design/methodology/approach: Participants included 18 children between five and seven years of age and their parents. Data were collected using a multi-stage participatory approach. Children shared their experiences via a book discussion, poster activity, participant-generated photography and a photo-elicitation interview. Parents provided information about family demographics and their perceptions of their children's individual interests, information practices and digital media use via questionnaires. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Findings: Young children seek information via print and digital objects, other people and experiences, and use information by applying it to their activities and sharing information with others. Challenges to information activities include children's own capabilities and skills, constraints of information sources and parental restrictions on their activities. Enablers include affordances of technology and parental support. Originality/value: This study takes a holistic approach to understanding young children's perspectives of their information activities, examining information use and sharing activities in addition to information seeking.

AB  - Engaged communication between mother and a child in their early developmental stages is one of the predictors of children's development of higher-order thinking skills. For deaf children, this engaged communication between mother and child hinges on the home language environment (HLE) being fully accessible to the child. This research uses agogical phenomenology in exploring the lived experiences of participants' HLE where sign language is used, with particular focus on the opportunities for extended discourse. Data were collected via semistructured interviews with the deaf children and their parents and observations in the HLEs of five signing families with at least one deaf child in the southwestern United States. The aim of this study was to document and provide insights into how language use in deaf children's HLE can impact their knowledge development; these insights uncovered the essence of reciprocal and contingent family interactions as a central aspect of the deaf child's HLE. It is hoped that the qualitative phenomenological findings will frame subsequent quantitative investigations of the variability in language access to home language components.

AB  - The transition to college is a critical determinant of student success in higher education. Increasingly, students' parents play a key role in supporting their sons and daughters as they adjust to the academic and social demands of university. However, little research has been conducted into parents' experiences of their child's transition to college. Arnett's theory of emerging adulthood is concerned with the developmental stage typically associated with students. Parents of university students were invited to describe the challenges faced by students in the transition to college. Quantitative and qualitative data were elicited on the parents' experiences of students' transition to higher education. A survey was conducted, and participants were interviewed at key points during one academic year. Parents reported struggling with changes in their home and family life during this phase. They expressed mixed and complex views on the adult status of their children. They also sought direct communication and guidance from the university to support more effectively their child during the transition process. The findings of the study are discussed in the light of Arnett's theory of emerging adulthood and implications are highlighted in this regard. Recommendations are made regarding transition planning, effective communication with parents and the provision of academic and personal support systems to facilitate the successful transition of students to college.

AB  - Most current autism research focuses on Western countries, where service availability and cultural experiences differ from those of individuals living in Asian countries, where collectivistic cultural values prevail and understanding of autism is emerging. By gathering data from Vietnamese parents of autistic children (N = 339), the current measurement study examined measure variance and invariance between the English version of the "Illness Perception Questionnaire--Revised for Autism Spectrum Disorder" (IPQ-R-ASD) and a Vietnamese translation of it, at the item, scalar, and factor levels. Results indicated measurement variance for only three of 37 items and highlighted different perceptions of autism between Vietnamese and North American parents, based on responses to the IPQ-R-ASD. Responses indicated that Vietnamese parents may have a different interpretation of the questions. Seven factors emerged on both the Vietnamese and English instruments, but items loaded differently, and a distinct factor emerged on the Vietnamese version. In sum, the current findings suggest that the IPQ-R-ASD can be useful for better understanding Vietnamese parents' perceptions of their children's autism, but the interpretation is somewhat different than on the English version, highlighting the importance of cross-cultural considerations in the study of autism in Western versus Eastern cultures.

AB  - Culturally Relevant Pedagogy and use of diverse picturebooks to support reading development and social-emotional skills are gaining acceptance and broader use. With this shift, new measures of efficacy are needed to confirm, bolster, and source new policies and strategies for family and classroom literacy practices. To this end, the Reading Builds Empathy (RBE) literacy study sought to develop and pilot a new instrument that uses picturebook reading as a way to understand empathy development. The RBE study participants included 21 parent-child dyads (N = 42) and piloted a tool that was created to measure children's empathy development for children ages six-eight. The tool includes collecting parent reports of children's at-home literacy practices and engagement with picturebooks as well as parents' perspectives on their child's empathy development. The tool also includes a researcher-administered tool to directly measure children's empathy development in a developmentally appropriate format across three domains: affective, cognitive, and ethnocultural empathy. This paper describes the process for instrument development, initial pilot data, considerations for changes to the instrument, and ideas for how the instrument can be used in future intervention studies.

AB  - This study dissects a cross-border linguistic dilemma and critiques the missed opportunities for linguistic diversity in Taiwan. Past studies have shown that immigrant mothers from Southeast Asia are discouraged from transmitting the cultures and languages of their home countries to their children, yet few voices have been heard from the mothers themselves. Taking a poststructuralist approach on identity and employing life story interviews, the study examines the mothers' language experiences and explores how their language choices as mothers are constructed by and reconstructing the changing family, social, and national contexts. The mothers' narratives reveal that whether to pass down their first language to their children is an on-going, complex decision-making process shaped by one's immigration status, dynamic family relationships and roles, and changing life circumstances. The study contributes to the field by highlighting these mothers' native tongues in such immigrant families as sites of oppression and liberation as we envision equitable, multicultural societies in Taiwan.

AB  - School reentry after inpatient psychiatric hospitalization requires careful coordination between multiple team members to ensure stability across transitions, given documented negative academic and socioemotional impacts in the post-discharge period. Existing investigations are limited by the fact that no articles examine the perspectives of multiple participant types simultaneously. We conducted a qualitative study of multiple children transitioning out of psychiatric hospitalization and their adult reentry team members, utilizing thematic analysis informed by grounded theory. Across 16 semi-structured interviews, we analyzed perspectives from 17 participants: four children, four parents, five school staff, and four hospital staff. We identified four key themes informing an overarching theory: 1) Centering the socioemotional role of school; 2) Clarifying what constitutes good communication; 3) Reconciling multiple sources of authority; and 4) Navigating limitations with creativity. Together, these themes converge into two new theoretical concepts. First, "stereovision" represents the synthesis of multiple "lines of sight," which cross to create a densely interactional system. Second, "patchworking" represents the cobbling together of case-by-case solutions to develop an adequate support plan in the face of multiple limitations or barriers. In conclusion, by incorporating the above four thematic findings into a novel theoretical framework, we argue that when navigating school reentry after psychiatric hospitalization, children and adults must use stereovision and patchworking to create a strong, flexible support fabric. These reflections increase representation of child and adult team member voices in the literature and inform future school--hospital--family partnerships for school reentry after psychiatric hospitalization.

AB  - Early childhood practitioners, including speech-language pathologists (SLPs), frequently provide home practice to children and families. For children with speech sound disorder (SSD), who comprise a large proportion of SLPs' caseloads worldwide, completing home practice can increase the amount of intervention received and improve outcomes. However, little is known about parents' experiences of completing this home practice. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore parents' experiences of completing home practice for children with SSD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six parents. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze data and identify four themes: "evolution over time," "different roles," "importance," and "managing the practicalities of home practice." The findings speak to the complexities of this experience for families and the need for practitioners to collaborate with families when providing home practice. These findings have implications for the home practice that early intervention practitioners provide to children and families.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a virtual parenting intervention designed to support parents of incoming kindergartners (N = 45) by bolstering their parental self-efficacy during the summer of 2020, immediately following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this group-based intervention provided parents with weekly psychoeducation of parenting skills to support their child's development and wellbeing, a toolkit of kindergarten readiness resources, and social support with other parents. Parent self-efficacy was collected pre and post intervention utilizing the Parent Empowerment and Efficacy Measure (PEEM). Paired samples t-tests demonstrated statistically significant increases in parents' overall self-efficacy, t(44) = 3.55, p < 0.05, and efficacy to connect to resources following the intervention, t(44) = 4.30, p < 0.05. Focus groups explored parents' perceived growth and confidence to parent and the quality of the relationship with their child after the intervention. Thematic analyses illuminated five core themes, including increased confidence in managing their child's behavior and emotional regulation, increased ability to perspective take with their child, increased knowledge of milestones and child development, improved conscientiousness and intentional parenting skills, and an increased efficacy to utilize a toolkit of parent resources and skills. Results and implications are discussed regarding how school psychologists and other school staff can support the home learning environment of families during the transition to kindergarten to promote optimal child development.

AB  - As community college students often come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, report greater financial challenges, and experience higher cohort default rates on student loans compared to peers attending four-year institutions, it is important to understand how community college students develop a sense of financial wellness. Moreover, research has also found that community college students, many of them students of Color, rely heavily on family to persist toward graduation. As a result, this study analyzes qualitative data from 14 community college students who reported on whether they viewed their family as financial education resources and what specific lessons they learned from their family to improve their financial wellness. Results suggest many community college students may not have family with extensive experience in and knowledge of financial sectors (e.g., banking, finance, investment) and education concepts (e.g., savings accounts, building credit, budgeting), and therefore, have little financial education to impart. In addition, many community college students' financial education was limited to knowledge of saving, with students rarely reporting their family imparting any education about many other finance concepts. Finally, community college students witnessed reverse role modeling when it came to money management from their parents, often teaching these students what not to do with their finances. Implications for community college research, policy, and practice are addressed.

AB  - This study aims to examine the meaning-making of parents in five Icelandic preschools concerning the collaboration between preschools and families. Further, the perspectives of educators on the views of the parents were also sought. The theoretical background was Moss's ideas of democratic early childhood education and MacNaughton's ideas of power relationships between parents and educators. Data were gathered in two steps: first, focus group interviews were conducted with parents; and second, focus group interviews were conducted with a group of preschool educators who reflected upon the parent interviews. The parents and educators seemed to have similar experiences and views of the parent-professional collaboration, and of the division of power and knowledge between the two groups. The type of collaboration the parents and the educators described is not in line with democratic preschool pedagogy as explained by Moss. The parents from other cultures who participated in the study were in a marginalised position, and the educators seemed to be unsure about how to communicate with and accommodate families from cultures different from their own. The study reveals power relationships on many levels in the preschool community.

AB  - Parenting a child with a disability can be stressful, and research has shown that burdens related to that care may overload parents and have negative effects on their quality of life. Thus, it is important to support families beginning early in their parenting experience and provide them with a strong foundation of tools and information. This study was an exploratory investigation of parent support structures in early childhood special education and examined the perceptions of support from parents/caregivers of preschoolers with disabilities. Using Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory, three ecological contexts (school, system, and social) were identified as potential sources of support. Of the three, parents reported higher feelings of support from school and system and indicated a variety of specific supports from these contexts that they found helpful. Findings demonstrate the positive influence of informal support. Expanding awareness and reach of parent-to-parent (P2P) programs, where parents of children with disabilities support one another and develop a community through social events, social media, trainings, and mentoring, may further empower parents and offer them community and sources of coping and support.

AB  - Background: Despite the considerable number of young adults with developmental disabilities experiencing sexual desire and exhibiting sexual behaviours as part of their natural biological growth and development, there is a lack of research on effective intervention. This study aimed to explore the views and experiences of professionals on the sexual behaviours of individuals with developmental disabilities. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with eight professionals specialising in developmental disabilities and/or inappropriate sexual behaviours were conducted, and their responses were analysed using a qualitative method. Results: Professionals' experiences were categorised into three based on the groups involved in intervention: people with developmental disabilities (desire, factors leading to lack of desire fulfilment), their family/parents (emotions and cognition/behaviours toward their child's disability and sexuality), and professionals (current intervention method, lack of human/material resources). Conclusion: Based on these findings, we suggest future directions for interventions to address sexual behaviours among individuals with developmental disabilities.

AB  - The current study aims to identify Jordanian mothers' perspectives on their intellectually disabled daughters receiving hysterectomies. A qualitative methodology was employed; for the study sample, twelve mothers were chosen using a snowballing technique. Semi-structured interviews were carried out, and thematic analysis was utilized. Two main themes arose from the data analysis process: the reasons why mothers made the decision for their daughters to have hysterectomies -- which included fears about unwanted pregnancy and keeping family honor -- despite this conflicting with their religious and cultural values, and their concerns about their daughters having hysterectomies. Based on these findings, some implications and suggestions for future research were provided.

AB  - Directional associations between civic engagement and happiness were explored with longitudinal data from a community sample surveyed four times from age 22 to 43 (n = 690). Autoregressive cross-lagged models, controlling for cross-time stabilities in happiness and civic engagement, examined whether happiness predicted future civic engagement, civic engagement predicted future happiness, or the temporal ordering was bidirectional. Marital status, parental status, and recent unemployment experience were included as time-varying covariates of civic engagement, and analyses controlled for parent education, self-esteem, and self-rated physical health at age 18. Results indicated consistent cross-lagged associations from higher happiness to higher future civic engagement. There was no support for the path from civic engagement to future happiness, nor for bidirectional associations. Parenthood at age 22 predicted lower civic engagement, while parenthood at ages 32 and 43 predicted higher civic engagement. Recent unemployment experience was associated with less civic engagement at age 32 but more engagement at age 43, and marital status was linked with more civic engagement at age 43. Results support a broaden-and-build theoretical perspective in which happiness predicts future civic engagement across the transition to adulthood and into midlife.

AB  - This article presents the findings from a study that explored how the language practices and management to which 156 students from universities in China reported being exposed at home, alongside their language beliefs, use of their entire linguistic repertoire when reading, listening, speaking, and writing at university, and emotions related to being multilingual predicted the language practices and management they envisioned for their own families. Data were gathered through a comprehensive questionnaire administered on campus. The results revealed that the more participants reported exposure to multilingual language practices at home and the stronger their beliefs in the benefits of a multilingual upbringing, the more determined they were to implement multilingual language practices with their own families. Moreover, using languages fluidly at university correlated positively with participants' desire to adopt a more conscious approach to language management in their future families.

AB  - This study examines the outcome of incongruence between home and school religious environments on predicting adolescent identification with religious values and worldview in Israeli religious high schools, and the possible mediating effects of general and identity-related aspects of school climate. The study compares Jewish students from religious observant Orthodox families with those from less-observant "Masorti" ("traditionalist") families. A total of 9090 Israeli high school students from 76 religious public schools participated. Students identified their parent's home as "Religious" or "Masorti" and filled out a measure on their own religious identification. School climate indices surveyed included aspects of good teacher-student and school-student relationships, and climate indices related to identity development processes. Results demonstrate that students from "Masorti" families experience school less favorably and identify less with school values. Identity climate indices were involved in mediating this relationship, demonstrating that school pedagogies fostering positive identity processes may play a key role in value formation in adolescence.

AB  - Persistent school non-attendance (PSNA) is a widely acknowledged problem. Family coaches work intensively with families where a child or young person (CYP) has persistently poor or no school attendance and there is unemployment or anti-social behaviour. Their work extends across different systems, which gives them a unique, multi-factored understanding of the phenomenon of PSNA in coaching families. The aim of this grounded theory (GT) study was to draw upon the experiences and perspectives of coaches in one UK local authority, to understand what helps and hinders successful intervention. A GT emerged, in which PSNA in coaching families was a "red flag," occurring when CYP felt unsafe. This was a product of the home environment not providing a secure base, parents having a diminished capacity and the CYP feeling that their situation was invisible. Successful intervention was relationship-based; improved the visibility of CYP; and increased parenting capacity. Intervention was constrained by conflicting systems that resisted or sabotaged change.

AB  - This study investigates barriers to facilitating family-school partnerships with immigrant families as identified by teachers in an urban school district with high rates of immigration. Participants consisted of 18 elementary teachers who identified predominantly as Hispanic (38.9%) or non-Hispanic White (33.3%), were frequently bilingual (55.6%), and were mostly female (94.4%) with an average age of 36.5 years. Participants engaged in focus group interviews that were transcribed and open-coded. Barriers to engagement for immigrant families fell into 3 broad areas: language and culture, family resources, and families' undocumented status. Many teachers attributed the barriers preventing parental collaboration to school policies (94.4%) and ineffective communication strategies (83.3%). Teachers also identified barriers as emanating from the families themselves, including families not attending school functions (88.9%) and being unresponsive to school-initiated communication (72.2%). Teachers noted that many families lacked resources necessary for school engagement (88.9%) and were hesitant to become engaged with schools due to required screening procedures (55.6%). Overall, numerous barriers to effective family engagement were identified, several of which are directly related to immigration and residency status. Given the strong evidence suggesting that family engagement in education mediates risk for children of recent immigrants, strategies to foster meaningful engagement for all families are desperately needed (Naughton, 2004). Roles for school psychologists to facilitate effective family-school partnerships are discussed.

AB  - The war that began in 2011 caused many Syrians to immigrate. There are more than 2.9 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. With this unprecedented migration, Turkey has faced challenges in its education system as well as many other areas. The sudden increase in the number of students and the qualitative and quantitative insufficiencies of teachers are among some of these challenges. Teachers are forced to work with children who have undergone traumatic events and experience economic, familial, psychological, and vital problems. Additionally, these children are forced to adapt to a new language, culture, and education system. It is necessary to help these children adapt to the education system and provide the support they need. When fighting these challenges, school counselors play an important role for both teachers and students. In this context, the purpose of this study was to determine guidance services of counsellors regarding Syrian students, challenges, and views regarding these problems. The participants of this study consisted of 20 counselors working in elementary schools in Bursa. Data were collected with the semi-structured interview method in qualitative research methods and analysed with descriptive analysis. The results of this study indicated that counsellors struggle planning, although they are motivated to work with Syrian students. The largest obstacle faced by counselors is the fact that Syrian students do not know Turkish. The indifference of the parents of Syrian students and the high number of students also limit counselors. While offered psychological counseling and guidance (PCG) services focused on individual interviews and guidance to teachers, there is also work for the acceptance of Syrian students. The most important expectation is to prioritize to teach Turkish to students. It is believed that both Syrian students and their family, and other students and teachers will benefit from all improvements in PCG services by considering Syrian students.

AB  - Sensory-Based Interventions (SBIs) are often recommended to enable function/participation in children with ASD. Still, there are limited studies to evaluate their effectiveness. Acceptability studies are an important step towards establishing effective interventions. We examined parents' perceptions of the uptake and acceptability of such interventions. An online survey was sent to 399 families; response rate was 39%. The most frequently therapist-recommended interventions were trampoline (54.6%), massage (47.8%), and oral-motor tools (43.8%). Highest use was reported for massage (96.3%), trampoline (89.2%) and joint compressions and brushing (89.2%). The majority of parents viewed these interventions to be very important /important, (74.8%) but barriers to their use were identified. High acceptability of SBIs was reported by parents of children with ASD.

AB  - This study concerns integration in a two-way dual language immersion (DLI) context. Specifically, the present study examines parents of students in Korean-English DLI programs with the intent to understand the extent of their satisfaction with their child's ability to get along with children of different cultures and languages. This study also examines parental views on integration among parents themselves. Using the survey data collected from over 450 parents in seven elementary schools in southern California, this quantitative study also investigates to what degree the variables of integration among children and among parents are associated with other parental demographic characteristics and parental experiences in their child's DLI program. Based on the study findings, this study argues that integration in DLI must be a school-wide commitment and not simply a program's goal. Moreover, to achieve integration in DLI, all stakeholders of the program need to be considered, including students, educators, and families of students in the school. This study also highlights the need to diversify discussions regarding DLI programs in terms of target languages, program types, and school locations.

AB  - Epistemic agency is situated within social, cultural, and material contexts of learning. Making and inventing supports children's and families' creative thinking, problem-solving, and knowledge construction, through which they are positioned as active knowledge agents and their epistemic agency is represented. This article examines how the epistemic agency of children and parents shifted as they engaged in making activities in a museum-based makerspace. Through video-based, multimodal interaction analysis of thirteen cases, our findings demonstrate moment-by-moment transition patterns between child-led, parent-led, and equally-distributed epistemic agency. Our findings also show how these epistemic agency shifts emerged through the families' embodied interactions. By doing so, we reveal that (a) the lead epistemic agent role shifted over time during the inventing experience and (b) the epistemic agency of a parent and a child were relative to each other. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of epistemic agency in situ during collaborative making activities as a fluid phenomenon as well as provides practical implications for museum-based makerspaces to support parent-child knowledge-building interactions during inventing.

AB  - Research Findings: Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations among the family pandemic experience, home activities during the stay-at-home quarantine, and level of parental stress. The results showed that, Chinese parents perceived only significantly higher stress related to children's behavioral and emotional difficulties during the pandemic. Parents' educational level and teacher remote support were significantly associated with the frequency of different home activities for young children. Although family direct exposure of COVID-19 was a critical risk factor predicting parent-perceived stress, parents' education, family income, and teachers' support were important protective factors for parents' stress. Some learning-focused home activities showed an inverse association with parental stress. Practices or Policy: The findings of this study point to the importance of supporting parents to provide quality home-based learning for their young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional support should also focus on the quality of parent-child interaction in addition to the promotion of children's learning experience at home.

AB  - This chapter identifies factors influencing doctoral candidates' mobility plans based on empirical studies as well as theories of social inequality and migration. The relative importance of the identified factors is assessed through a series of linear and logistic regressions, which are calculated based on data from a 2010 online survey of doctoral candidates employed at German universities. The theoretical considerations are mostly confirmed: mobility experiences during the previous studies and during the doctorate mobilise doctoral candidates to plan further research periods abroad. Moreover, contextual factors play an important role. For instance, working in an internationalised institutional environment and having regular contact with academics abroad increase the likelihood of developing mobility plans. Regarding social factors, age turns out to be negatively associated with mobility plans. Parenthood also affects mobility plans negatively, but only among female doctoral candidates. Contrary to the hypothesis, we do not find that a high social background significantly increases the likelihood of planning a research period abroad. [For the complete volume, "Academic Mobility.

AB  - Among the many impacts of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, one of the most dramatic was the immediate closure of in-person schooling in March/April 2020 when parents were faced with much greater responsibility in supporting their children's learning. Despite this, few studies have examined parents' own perspectives of this experience. The aims of this preliminary study were to: (1) identify challenges, benefits, and useful strategies related to remote learning; and (2) examine differences in findings across two countries, between parents of youth with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and between parents of children and adolescents. To address these aims, parent responses to open-ended questions on the Home Adjustment to COVID-19 Scale (HACS; Becker, Breaux, et al., 2020) were examined across three studies conducted in the United States and Australia (N = 606, children: 68.5% male, ages 6-17 years). The challenges most frequently expressed by parents included the child's difficulty staying on task (23.8% of parents), lack of motivation (18.3%), remote learning factors (17.8%), and lack of social interaction (14.4%). The most frequently expressed strategy related to using routines and schedules (58.2%) and the biggest benefit was more family time (20.3%). Findings were largely consistent across countries, ADHD status, and age, with a few notable group differences. Given that the most common challenges involved child- (e.g., difficulties with staying on task and motivation), parent- (e.g., balancing remote learning with work responsibilities), and school- (e.g., remote instruction difficulties) related factors, there is a need for improved support across these systems going forward.

AB  - This chapter explores the concept of a Dominant Language Constellation (DLC) in a Canadian context and links it to family language policy (FLP) and language of schooling. The focus is on the province of Ontario where English is the majority language and French a minority language, along with various other minority languages, including heritage/immigrant languages and Indigenous languages, spoken in families and communities. In this rich context, FLP plays an important role in the transmission and maintenance of minority languages. Beyond primary language socialization at the family level, however, an important and powerful factor that also influences a child's linguistic trajectory is the choice of language of schooling (typically English or French) made by parents. I report results from a mixed-methods study involving questionnaire data from the families of 170 school-age children growing up as bilinguals or multilinguals and follow-up interview data from a subset of 20 families. The analysis identifies an interplay of family internal strategies and school language choices that influence children's DLCs in important ways and account for differences in bilingual and multilingual constellations (i.e. number of languages), language dominance, passive versus active bi/multilingualism, and changes in constellation configurations over time.

AB  - Background: This implementation feasibility study was conducted to determine whether an evidence-based parent-implemented distance-learning intervention model for young children at high likelihood of having ASD could be implemented at fidelity by Part C community providers and by parents in low-resource communities. Methods: The study used a community-academic partnership model to adapt an evidence-based intervention tested in the current pilot trial involving randomization by agency in four states and enrollment of 35 coaches and 34 parent-family dyads. After baseline data were gathered, providers in the experimental group received 12-15 h of training while control providers received six webinars on early development. Providers delivered 6 months of intervention with children-families, concluding with data collection. Regression analyses were used to model outcomes of the coach behaviors, the parent fidelity ratings, and child outcomes. Results: A block design model-building approach was used to test the null model followed by the inclusion of group as a predictor, and finally the inclusion of the planned covariates. Model fit was examined using changes in R[superscript 2] and "F"-statistic. As hypothesized, results demonstrated significant gains in (1) experimental provider fidelity of coaching implementation compared to the control group; and (2) experimental parent fidelity of implementation compared to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups on child developmental scores. Conclusions: Even though the experimental parent group averaged less than 30 min of intervention weekly with providers in the 6 months, both providers and parents demonstrated statistically significant gains on the fidelity of implementation scores with moderate effect sizes compared to control groups. Since child changes in parent-mediated models are dependent upon the parents' ability to deliver the intervention, and since parent delivery is dependent upon providers who are coaching the parents, these results demonstrated that two of these three links of the chain were positively affected by the experimental implementation model. However, a lack of significant differences in child group gains suggests that further work is needed on this model. Factors to consider include the amount of contact with the provider, the amount of practice children experience, the amount of contact both providers and parents spend on training materials, and motivational strategies for parents, among others.

AB  - The closure of school buildings due to COVID-19 and the resulting rapid transition to online education dramatically altered the lives of educators, students and parents. While previous literature demonstrates the vital role of parents in effective online education (Hattie, 2020; Liu et al, 2010), pre-pandemic literature focuses on parents and students who have opted in to online education. As such, the outbreak of COVID-19 has presented new challenges for understanding the relationship between parents and their child/ren's online learning. Since the start of the pandemic, studies have emerged exploring parental experience adjusting to their child/ren's online remote learning (Bhamani et al, 2020; Brom et al, 2020; Dong et al, 2020; Garbe et al, 2020; Lee et al, 2021). However, less is known about the online learning experiences during COVID-19 of families with children enrolled within international schools. Accordingly, the present study draws upon insights from 44 parents of children attending international schools who took part in 22 focus groups, across three countries and in three languages. The study investigates the parental experience with online education and unpacks four themes that emerged from the data: challenges faced by parents, parental perception of their child/ren's wellbeing, impressions of the learning quality and parental suggestions for consideration by school leadership. With these findings, school leaders have a unique opportunity to leverage lessons learned and support parental growth so that families, educators and students may all contribute to the promise of a brighter educational future.

AB  - Research documents persistent gender inequality in the educational experiences of second-generation immigrant (SGI) students whose parents immigrated to the United States. This qualitative study draws from 27 in-depth interviews to explore the experiences of SGI women as they navigate the senior-year transition in conversation with their parents. Findings show how beliefs regarding gender inform the contours of parental expectations for soon-to-be graduates. SGI women confronted a series of gendered expectations for (a) family life and marriage, (b) future careers and further education, and (c) geographic mobility. These dynamics became especially salient for women participants with brothers who were not subjected to the same expectations. SGI women described these expectations as manifestations of gendered double standards. Findings have implications for how higher education can address gender inequality and support SGI women in the senior-year transition.

AB  - Family literacy programmes operate on the periphery of American education and often employ a deficit orientation toward minoritized families; still, parents view these programmes as language-learning resources. This ethnographic study explores the experiences of Latina mothers enrolled in a school-based family literacy programme in Nebraska to understand what sustained their involvement. Utilising Brandt's (2001. "Literacy in American Lives." Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press) literacy sponsorship framework, it suggests that the programme personnel somewhat shared the mothers' literacy sponsorship and, consequently, provided a learning experience that supported participants in meeting their goals. Observation and interview data showed two partially agreed upon sponsors of literacy: enriched livelihoods and spending time with children. Despite variations in other perspectives and goals, each had similar continuing stakes in participating in the programme. This agreement illuminated how the programme was responsive to mothers' goals, despite its deficit lens, and suggests a vantage point for developing more culturally congruent family literacy programmes.

AB  - The present study sought to understand parents' perspectives on the ease with which they felt they could play with their children during the initial period of social distancing. Seven hundred and five participants answered a 48-item questionnaire. This manuscript is focused on one Likert-type scale question and an open-ended follow-up question. Almost two thirds of participants indicated they felt indifference or that it was difficult to play with their children during social distancing. Five hundred and nine participants provided feedback for their answers. Thematic analysis was used to code and categorize these comments. Participants provided varied reasons for how they viewed playing with their children during social distancing, which were used to create five themes: Work and Professional Role, Mental & Physical Health, Time, Access to Resources, and Parenting Factors. The researchers offer implications for promoting play during times of social distancing.

AB  - Studies of early reading in the home indicate the relevance of these experiences for young children's later reading development when they start school. The study reported here followed twenty children through 2 years prior to starting school and assessed their reading progress at the start of school. Audio/tape-recordings of their home experiences were collected in some detail, at random during whole days and transcripts of the audio/tape-recordings were reviewed for instances of reading experiences. In addition, parent interviews reported activities with their children, including those not captured on the audio/tape-recordings and others that took place across different days not recorded. Strong relationships were found between measures of family interest in reading and their children's reading development when they started school. It was also found that Socioeconomic Status (SES) of family background did not necessarily determine these children's reading development. Those children who had the opportunity to form successful understandings about reading from their home experiences, arrived at school with strong conceptual frameworks that supported their continuing reading development.

AB  - Purpose: The researchers conducted a collective case study to investigate how families engaged in making activities related to aerospace engineering in six pop-up makerspace programs held in libraries and one museum. The purpose of this paper is to support families' engagement in design tasks and engineering thinking, three types of discussion prompts were used during each workshop. The orienting design conjecture was that discussion prompts would allow parents to lead productive conversations to support engineering-making activities. Design/methodology/approach: Within a collective case study approach, 20 consented families (22 adults, 25 children) engaged in making practices related to making a lunar rover with a scientific instrument panel. Data included cases of families' talk and actions, as documented through video (22 h) and photographs of their engineering designs. An interpretivist, qualitative video-based analysis was conducted by creating individual narrative accounts of each family (including transcript excerpts and images). Findings: Parents used the question prompts in ways that were integral to supporting youths' participation in the engineering activities. Children often did not answer the astronomer's questions directly; instead, the parents revoiced the prompts before the children's engagement. Family prompts supported reflecting upon prior experiences, defining the design problem and maintaining the activity flow. Originality/value: Designing discussion prompts, within a broader project-based learning pedagogy, supports family engagement in engineering design practices in out-of-school pop-up makerspace settings. The work suggests that parents play a crucial role in engineering workshops for youths aged 5 to 10 years old by revoicing prompts to keep families' design work and sensemaking talk (connecting prior and new ideas) flowing throughout a makerspace workshop.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted daily life, including the educational experiences of school-age children with and without disabilities and their families who supported them. This descriptive qualitative study examined the experiences of families with children with extensive support needs and complex communication needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in relation to their (a) supports and (b) feelings of empowerment related to their child. Participants were 37 parents of children with disabilities who had extensive support needs and complex communication needs, with most families having a child with either autism or Down syndrome. Interviews were conducted with each family at three time points during the 2020-2021 school year. Results indicated that the supports families received varied widely, as did their feelings of empowerment--including empowerment related to advocacy and to supporting their child's learning and well-being at home. The supports that families received from providers (e.g., teachers, service providers) impacted their feelings of empowerment, sometimes acting as facilitators and sometimes as barriers. Implications for future research and practice are discussed related to how teachers and other providers might better partner with families during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

AB  - This study reports feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of a pilot of START; a 12-week parent-toddler, group-based, neurodiversity-affirming programme aiming to support executive function development in toddlers at elevated likelihood of autism or ADHD. After 4 days' training, community early years practitioner pairs delivered START to 13 UK families with a toddler showing elevated autistic traits, or with a parent or sibling with autism or ADHD, in groups of 6 and 7. Sessions were audio-recorded and rated by practitioners and researchers regarding the extent to which programme and session aims were met. Practitioners' reflections on strengths and challenges in session delivery, adaptations to the session plan and researchers' observations from the audio recordings were probed in weekly debrief calls, and one-to-one interviews at programme end-point. Recruitment and retention were monitored. Parent participants were asked to complete a feedback questionnaire after each session. Results show recruitment to the programme is feasible, but a large minority of parents experience barriers to regular attendance, which is a challenge for achieving exposure targets. Practitioners delivered the programme to a high quality and at least partially met programme and session-specific aims in every session. The most significant barrier to fully meeting session aims was families' late arrival. Parents reported regularly engaging with the suggested activities at home and found the sessions useful, although not all parents responded each week. Overall, the results of this small-scale pilot indicate START is feasible and acceptable as a parent-mediated programme to support toddlers at elevated likelihood of autism or ADHD to thrive.

AB  - The present study aims to delineate the effects of family violence and parent-adolescent conflict on antisocial behavior exhibited by adolescents in the Chinese casino city of Macau. The social interaction perspective indicates the significance of coercive family processes in relation to adolescents' antisocial behavior, and the related moderating role of positive parenting behavior. How this process is experienced by Chinese Macau adolescents, who are influenced by traditional Chinese culture, is explored. This article examines the relationship of family violence and parent-adolescent conflict with adolescents' antisocial behavior in Macau. It also examines the possible moderating role of parental support in this relationship. Using a stratified proportional approach, a random sample of 1889 Grade 7 to Grade 12 students was taken from Macau high schools. The young people reported their neutral/positive behavior and delinquent behavior, family conflict, and emotional and instrumental support they received from parents. Multiple regression analyses suggest that family violence and parent-adolescent conflict are correlated with adolescent antisocial behavior. Moreover, both instrumental and emotional support from parents can moderate the effect of family conflict on adolescents' antisocial behavior. Parents providing instrumental and emotional support to Macau Chinese adolescents is negatively correlated with adolescent antisocial behavior in Macau. In view of the long and unstable working hours of parents working in a gambling city, social workers in Macau could develop more innovative programs to support parents in Macau.

AB  - Research on inclusive education (IE) documents benefits for both students with disabilities and students without disabilities. Internationally, IE is frequently aligned with the Salamanca Statement and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Salamanca Statement affirms 'the right to education of every individual...regardless of individual differences.' IE in Mexico has a brief and turbulent history. Of the 15% of students in Mexico who have a disability, only 2.85% receive IE. In addition, research on IE in Mexico is sparse. This exploratory study investigates the perspectives regarding IE among educators and family caregivers of children with and without disabilities schools in Mexico City, Mexico. Results show a prevalent support for IE among parents and teachers. Implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed.

AB  - This study examined families' experiences of a publicly funded, play-based early learning program for children in the year before school entry. An online survey was conducted with parents and/or guardians (n = 291) to learn about their child's outcomes in the program, their perception of play-based learning, attitudes toward the program, and how the program supported their family. Socio-demographic information was also collected (income, education). A concurrent triangulation mixed methods design was used in the analysis of quantitative and qualitative survey questions through descriptive and inferential statistics, followed by content analysis of open-ended responses. The majority of parents felt their child was supported by the program and would transition more easily to the first year of school as a result of participating. The results also indicate the importance of connection to school community and good communication with a child's educators as predictors for positive attitudes toward play-based learning. Overall, the study reinforces the importance of publicly funded quality early childhood education and ensuring that parents value the play-based philosophy of these programs.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the effects of parents' home and school-based involvement, parental satisfaction with their own school experience and their teens' academic success, the frequency of communication from school; participants' and their teens' gender; parents' educational status; and family income on the academic success of adolescents. A total of 349 parents having different socioeconomic and educational backgrounds participated in the study. In the hypothetical model, the frequency of communication from the school, parents' educational status, family income, and parental satisfaction with their teen's academic success is taken as exogenous variables, while academic performance is taken as an endogenous variable as its assumed causes are clearly displayed in the model. The results showed that parental satisfaction with their teen's academic success is the most significant variable for predicting the academic success of adolescents. Besides, home-based involvement mediates the effects of the variables of parents' educational status and of their satisfaction with the teen's academic performance on the academic performance itself. In conclusion, parental satisfaction with the adolescent's academic success is important for its impact on parent-teen interaction and for the possibility of creating an environment that would support the adolescents' academic performance and education in general.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition, has become a major concern for both developed and underdeveloped countries since the condition is associated with significant caregiver, family, and financial burdens. Approaches to educating these children, especially in their preschool years, are burdensome and demanding for both parents and teachers. Although it is recommended that children with ASD receive inclusive, age-appropriate education in mainstream school settings, there are barriers in Ghana. This study explored barriers faced by preschool teachers in implementing and adhering to inclusive education for children with ASD. The study employed an exploratory descriptive qualitative design to sample 17 participants in the Greater Accra Region using a purposive sampling technique. Data was collected through an in-depth virtual interview and analyzed using content analysis. The study identified inadequate parental cooperation, poor ASD knowledge of the teachers, socio-cultural and political issues, and a lack of collaboration with other professionals as major barriers thwarting the success of inclusive education for children with ASD in Ghana. These barriers affect effective and successful adherence to inclusive education for children with ASD, and as such, we recommend orientation and special training for teachers, the provision of resources for effective child inclusion, and the creation of ASD awareness during the training of pre-school teachers.

AB  - This study examined the links between mothers' and fathers' emotion socialization practices and social behaviour between siblings. We utilized parent reports from 57 two-parent families with preschool- and toddler-aged siblings to assess parental responses to children's negative emotions, as well as siblings' engagement in positive involvement, conflict, and avoidance. Findings indicated that fathers', but not mothers', supportive and non-supportive emotion socialization strategies with the older sibling accounted for a significant amount of variance in older siblings' rivalry, aggression, and avoidance. Additionally, older siblings' rivalry/aggression and avoidance were positively linked to fathers' non-supportive reactions to both the older and younger siblings' negative emotions, highlighting the importance of a within-family approach to emotion socialization to elucidate effects across parents and siblings. Further research is needed to disentangle cause and effect relations among siblings' socio-emotional development and parents' emotion socialization practices.

AB  - The first three years of a child's life are of critical importance to the development of the brain. Children identified as not developing at a pace that is age level appropriate may be referred to early intervention services. This study identifies the successes as well as the various challenges that Latinx families encounter as they navigate the early intervention system. Through one-on-one interviews, the researchers in the current study explore the attitudes, values, and concerns of nine Latina mothers who accessed and received early intervention services for their children with developmental delays. Results from this study provide direction for the development of strategies and guidance for practitioners in the application of recommended practices.

AB  - The importance of Early Intervention for children with Autism has been established however little attention has been given to the role of the parent and their perspective (Griffin & Shevlin, 2011). Research on Early Intervention has proliferated and innovative research on involving parents as partners has emerged (Carpenter, 2007; Hornby, 2011), however parents' experiences of assessment, diagnosis and education have received little attention. This study investigated parental perceptions of Early Intervention services for children with significant disabilities. The purpose of this article is to describe how parents experience assessment, diagnosis and education, exploring the potential of utulising a parental lens in grasping these perspectives. It explored parents' need to negotiate services and the difficulties surrounding their children's education in mainstream settings. Through qualitative, longitudinal, in-depth case studies, parents (n = 6) were interviewed over a fifteen month period. Interviews coincided with school terms. A major point of difference is the presence of parent voice. This research is dedicated to eliciting parents' voice and exploring how this may influence current understandings of Early Intervention in Ireland. This research suggests that we need to explore what is needed by parents according to those parents, by acknowledging parent voice. Early Intervention and school settings may be a site of reconfiguration of parenthood where mutually, supportive mechanisms may confront the obscurities associated with their role and the fact that they are seldom heard.

AB  - In the midst of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, the virtual home visit became a key strategy among China's multiple approaches to ensure children's continuity of learning, sustain teacher-parent-child relationships, and promote home-preschool collaboration. In this study, using a small stories research narrative paradigm to analyze documented family engagement captured in social media data, we explore how early childhood educators relied on frequent, personal connections with children and families through virtual home visits to mitigate the negative effects of preschool closures in China. Results suggest that the exchange of information and socio-emotional supports during virtual home visits supported and enhanced home-preschool relationships. The virtual home visits evolved into a space for connection and collaboration between the educators and families. We use an ecological-exchange framework to discuss the implications of virtual home visit experiences across time and reflect on pedagogy and practice to enhance development of teachers in online interactions with children and families.

AB  - Families' mealtime talk has significant implications for children's language development. This study investigated five middle-class Australian Chinese families that differ in their lifestyles and meal routines. It aims to explore: (1) the nature of the Chinese parents' language use in interactions with children at mealtime; and (2) the factors that may impact the quality of mealtime talk. Drawing on systemic functional linguistic theory, the parents' language was analysed in terms of interpersonal functions and cohesive patterns. The findings show distinctive differences among the families. The parents sitting with children for meals generated a higher quality of language that contained informational functions, expanded in various cohesive patterns, than the families where parents were positioned separately from children or where fathers were absent from dinner. This study indicates the diversity of Chinese children's language experiences at home. Lifestyles and meal routines could be a mediator affecting the nature of mealtime talk.

AB  - Children with intellectual disability experience significant challenges in accessing and receiving high-quality healthcare leading to poorer health outcomes and negative patient experiences. Families of these children often report a need for healthcare staff to better understand, communicate, and collaborate for better care while staff acknowledge a lack of training. To address this, we utilised an action research framework with a pre- and post-survey to evaluate an integrated continuing professional development and quality improvement program combining strategies from education, behavioural psychology and quality improvement that was delivered in two departments within a tertiary children's Hospital in Metropolitan Sydney in 2019-2020. Parents reported noticeable changes in the clinical practice of staff, and staff acknowledged and attributed their shift in behaviour to raising awareness and discussions around necessary adaptations. The program demonstrates a novel method for knowledge translation to practice and systems improvements.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore family relationship experiences of first-generation college students (FGCS) as they transition to and persist through college. The sample includes eight undergraduate FGCS (aged 18-22). Seven participants identified as female, and one identified as Questioning. Participants' descriptions of their social class ranged from "poor" to "upper middle class." Four participants identified as White; others identified as White and Mexican, White and Hispanic, African American, and Mixed Race (White and Black). Participants for this study were recruited from a large public university in the Southeastern United States. Researchers used a qualitative phenomenological design. Following approval from the Institutional Review Board, data were collected through in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis guided by Structural Symbolic Interactionism. Parents, despite lacking college experience, offered supports, both instrumental (educational opportunities; monthly financial assistance) and emotional (encouraging calls; frequent visits), which students considered essential to their success. Many participants also stated that setting an example and forging a path for younger siblings helped to motivate them to persevere through hardships. Strength-based approaches are necessary when developing programs for and research on FGCSs and their families.

AB  - The authors' experiences with Latinx families confirm research that shows parents are willing and have the desire to help their children with their mathematics schoolwork (Colegrove and Krause 2016). However, structural barriers make it challenging for Spanish-speaking parents to support their children's mathematics learning. For example, districts that offer computer and high-speed internet access fall short when they fail to give technical assistance and instructions in families' native languages (Chandra et al. 2020). Parents cannot then access school communication about academics and parent meetings. When parents cannot participate in their children's learning, this reinforces deficit attitudes that schools have toward immigrant families (Colegrove and Krause 2016). However, social media can support communication with families and increase their mathematics resource use at home. In the United States, 72 percent of Hispanic adults regularly use social media, and smartphones are often their primary means of access to digital resources (PEW Research Center 2019). This article describes the authors' innovative approach to support and empower Latinx families with preschool-age children and leverages their high use of mobile phones by sharing videos modeling conversations about mathematical concepts. To study the usefulness, accessibility, and usability of this approach, they conducted a pilot program with Spanish-speaking families in Massachusetts.

AB  - Extensive research emphasises the importance of parental involvement for children's learning and academic achievement. This paper reports from a Norwegian study researching parents' experiences on follow-up after their child's cochlear implantation. Within this context, parental involvement is suggested to be of major importance for the child's language learning. The study explores the parents' talk on their involvement in the child's language after implantation. Data consist of 27 written parental accounts and interviews with 14 of these parents. The analysis shows the parents' extensive involvement in the child's language learning. The study brings into conversation how understandings of learning influence parental involvement, leading to implications for the parents and children involved. It addresses a need for debate on how parents can support children's learning, whilst avoiding parenthood becoming a series of educational tasks.

AB  - The 'What Being the Parent of a New Baby is Like--Revised' (WPL-R) is an instrument designed to measure adaptation to parenthood. In the process of pilot testing and validating the WPL-R in a postpartum Dutch population, we became aware of the potentially sensitive nature of the measure. Despite the ethics committee waiving the invasive nature of the measure, we conducted a survey to explore its possible effect on women's thoughts and emotions by using the Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to measure changes associated with completion of the WPL-R. Two hundred and fifteen questionnaires were returned. Our findings indicated a change in PANAS scores, implying an intervening effect when using the WPL-R, in research. This raises the question of whether it is acceptable to use a questionnaire with postpartum women without any knowledge of the possible effect it may have, even though the ethics committee has approved the study and considers the measure to be non-invasive.

AB  - In this study, the relationship between distributed leadership and family involvement in schools from parents' perspective was examined. The study was carried out with 1,488 secondary school parents in the Elazig province, Turkey. The Parent Distributed Leadership Perception Scale and Parent Family Involvement Questionnaire were employed. According to the results obtained from the research, parents' level of involvement in the school, and their level of dealing with their children's education, increase simultaneously with their positive perceptions on distributed leadership in schools. Furthermore, it can be observed that the distributed leadership perception in schools was a significant predictor of family involvement. Future recommendations were developed for practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained from the research.

AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to fill gaps in the literature based on institution type, career level, and gender identity. Design/methodology/approach: Faculty often struggle with achieving work-life balance. This struggle is exacerbated for faculty parents. Most academic parent research has been conducted on early-career women and at research-intensive universities. Although these groups are important, it is also important to understand experiences of academic parents at different career levels and types of institutions. The authors conducted a qualitative thematic analysis from focus groups with faculty from a mid-sized master's level university about work-life balance expectations and experiences in their roles as academics and parents. These four groups included early-career mothers (n = 5), early-career fathers (n = 4), mid-career mothers (n = 4), and mid-career fathers (n = 7). Findings: Faculty expressed having a high workload based on an intersection of high work expectations, unclear work expectations, and lack of equity. Consequences of the high workload included lower work-life balance, dissatisfaction at not doing more, the loss of flexibility as an advantage, and lower organizational commitment. Originality/value: Although results are limited in generalizability, it is useful to examine one institution, with all participants sharing the same culture and policies, in-depth. The authors discuss recommendations for educational administrators for assisting academic parents and suggest institutions work to examine informal expectations and formal policies at their institutions. Working together, faculty and staff can help enhance alignment of expectations and perceptions of work-life balance, hopefully leading to happier, more satisfied employees.

AB  - The study aims to determine rural families' experiences regarding sexual development of their adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 parents. Since the interviews included privacy issues, they were conducted one-to-one with the parents. The phenomenological method was used, depending on the research purpose. Inductive analysis was utilised in the analysis of the data obtained from the semistructured interviews. Validity and reliability were included in all stages of data collection, breakdown and analysis. As a result, the families stated that their children exhibited inappropriate socio-sexual behaviours during adolescence; they strive to teach their children sexuality issues, although they do not know how and they generally prefer carrying their children along to prevent sexual abuse. Also, due to not knowing much about sexuality, they generally received their relatives' support and requested comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) from special education teachers and other experts, especially about distinguishing good and bad people, menstruation and hiding sanitary pads. Although the literature reports that sexuality and its education are generally taboo, families in this study explained their thoughts on sexuality in full detail without tabooing. This makes the study different and meaningful, when compared to similar ones. The study was conducted in an eastern Turkey city with difficult access to special education. Thus, experts in rural areas are recommended to prepare and give necessary CSE programmes to families and individuals with special needs by conducting similar studies. These studies can be conducted not only with special education perspective but also in different disciplines. It is a basic human right for all individuals to receive CSE, thus as another recommendation, experts should give all children these courses in schools.

AB  - The aim of this study is to reveal the views of future psychologists on the training of suicide prevention among adolescents based on work with parents. The study was designed with a phenomenology pattern. The study data were collected with a semi-structured interview form prepared with questions suitable for the purpose of the study. The sample of the study consisted of psychologist candidates studying in Kazakhstan. As a result of the research, among the answers given to the question about the causes of suicide in adolescents were family, loneliness, hopelessness, psychological problems and temperament, and most of the participants answered psychological problems. Among the answers given to the question about determining what should be done in order to prevent suicide in adolescents based on working with parents were family education, early diagnosis, guidance of adolescents, prevention of alcohol and substance consumption, and the majority of the participants answered family education. The majority of the participants in the closed-ended question about the determination of the proficiency of future psychologists in preventing suicide in adolescents based on working with parents stated 'I definitely do not find it sufficient'. Among the answers given to the question about increasing efficacy in preventing suicide in adolescents based on working with parents were in-service trainings, experience and practice for disadvantaged groups, and the majority of the participants answered the question as in-service trainings.

AB  - The English language is a catalyst for economic growth, modernization, and globalization. In this milieu, English language competency--defined as the practical ability to use English effectively in diverse contexts, encompassing linguistic, cognitive, and intercultural skills--is recognized as an essential skill (Amor et al., 2023). Research on English language competency among ethnic minority students is sparse, obscuring the dynamics between personal and environmental factors. We analyzed factors influencing language competency, examining the interplay across the theory's five system levels using 82 research papers published from 2014 to 2024. The three factors most commonly discussed were at the individual level (psychological factors), the microsystem level (teachers and family), and the macrosystem level (language policies, sociocultural influences, and identity). Our analysis also revealed the importance of conducting thorough studies at various levels. These include the microsystem level, which involves examining the interactions between teachers, families, and students and the challenges faced in practical cooperation between parents, educators, and students. Additionally, the mesosystem level, which focuses on digital learning tools, the exosystem level, which considers factors such as socioeconomic status and mass media, and the chronosystem level, referring to discrete shifts like switching from a monolingual to a multilingual environment, are also crucial areas of study. The study ends with research directions highlighting the necessity for a holistic examination of the factors influencing EFL learning among ethnic minorities, and the need for future research to include broader and more diverse samples for a comprehensive cross-cultural analysis.

AB  - Conventional scholarship frames parent involvement in schools as crucial for student success, often depicts Black and Brown parents as under-engaged, and implies their increased engagement would lead to the end of racial disparities in education. This study challenges this traditional discourse and introduces the notion of Racial Realist Parent Engagement. Racial Realist Parent Engagement is a practice and theoretical framing drawn from Derrick Bell's notion of racial realism and a qualitative multicase study of the school engagement experiences of 16 Black parents. These parent participants resisted antiblackness in their children's schools while simultaneously recognizing racism to be a permanent and inevitable aspect of schooling. Racial Realist Parent Engagement shifts parent involvement theory, policy, and practice to a more complex understanding of the purposes and benefits of parent engagement for Black and Brown families -- and demands expansive racial justice policy for student learning.

AB  - A study of differences in the implementation of the Parent-Teacher Education Curriculum (PTEC) by four geographically and culturally diverse universities on preservice teacher (PST) learning about parent involvement has implications for teacher education practice. Participants included 1,948 PSTs from the four universities who studied and completed knowledge and attitude pre- and post-tests related to one or more PTEC module based on Epstein's six types of parent involvement. Quantitative analysis using two-way mixed ANOVA with repeated measures showed significant changes in knowledge and attitudes towards family engagement. Qualitative study of documents exposed associated differences in implementation of PTEC at all universities. The most successful implementation involved embedding the six modules in a common online course taught to early childhood/elementary PSTs. Other successful practices included supportive field experiences, teaching cultural competence, and in-depth discussion of case studies. Findings support continued study of the effect of curriculum based on Epstein's model.

AB  - Family-professional partnerships are an important predictor of student success for children with and without disabilities. However, little is known about the perspectives of fathers of children with complex disabilities regarding their partnerships with educational professionals. This study presents findings from semi-structured interviews with 15 fathers of children with complex disabilities regarding their partnerships with professionals. Fathers described both challenging and collaborative interactions with the educational professionals working with their children. In challenging interactions, fathers described educational professionals focused on the monetary costs of their child's educational needs, a struggle to find schools and programs that fit their child's needs, and educators who were inflexible and unwilling to implement individualized instructional strategies. More positive and collaborative father-professional partnerships were characterized by authentic relationships that responded to the expertise of parents, as well as educators who were flexible and strengths-based in their practice. Fathers offered guidance for how educators could strengthen partnerships with fathers. Findings from this study extend the very limited research on the school involvement experiences of fathers of children with complex disabilities by identifying specific characteristics of positive and negative family-professional interactions for these fathers and highlighting avenues for change in professional practice to strengthen fathers' school involvement experiences.

AB  - This paper examines children's perspectives on rural territories in two Colombian areas affected by armed conflict, exploring intersections of knowledge production, territory, and memory. Using Decolonial Perspectives and Escobar's territory concept, an educational collaborative ethnography was conducted. Territory is conceptualised as a biophysical and epistemic space shaped by community worldview. This paper reflects on how collaboration with children contributes to decolonising representations of conflict-affected rural territories, allowing the recognition of its values and the reconstruction of negative dominant representations. Data collection involved five months of participant observation, engaging children, teachers, parents, grandparents, community leaders, and researchers. Activities included walks, reading circles, workshops, map-making, and family garden visits to construct narratives about the past and present. Analysis revealed situated knowledge production, with territory acquiring semantic and experiential meaning. Peasant children's perspectives challenge homogenising discourses about childhood, war, peace, and rurality, emphasising agency and exploring multiple forms of knowledge.

AB  - Practice is essential to the acquisition and development of musical skills, requiring musicians' time, investment, application, motivation, metacognitive strategies, and ability to self-regulate. Research in children's music practice indicates the type, quality, and duration of practice, along with adult support, contributes to fluency in musical development; and when progress occurs, children invest in further practice. However, nuances in children's lived experiences of musical practice that influence these critical factors are largely unknown. To understand the complex issues in children's practice, this study employed a unique pairing of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and Participatory Action Research to investigate 14 seven-year-old beginner cellists' practice during early learning and explored how their thoughts and experiences evolved over the first 18 months of lessons. Providing rare insight into children's perceptions of musical development and the vital role of parents and teachers in nurturing engagement, three superordinate themes emerged: (a) four approaches to practice, characterized by practice structure, learner behavior, and family support, (b) a three-phase practice process, and (c) perfection ideation. Positive experiences, including creative activities, within these thematic contexts fostered children's enjoyment in early musical development, supported productive learning interactions, and sustained engagement. Together, the findings have meaningful pedagogical implications for instrumental music teaching practice.

AB  - Despite increasing understanding of the importance of including children and families from diverse backgrounds and family structures within early childhood education (ECE) programmes, little attention has been paid to how children and parents from Rainbow Families are included. This article draws on findings from two studies in Aotearoa New Zealand: the first was a national mixed-methods study focused on ECE teachers' perceptions and practices regarding work with children and families from diverse backgrounds, including those from Rainbow Families. The second study was a small qualitative research project that investigated four lesbian ECE teachers' experiences, and active disruption of heteronormative dominance within their ECE settings. Data from across the two projects reveal that there are risks for both parents from Rainbow Families and lesbian and gay teachers in being open about their family structures or sexual orientation and that there is silence, and thus a resulting invisibility, about Rainbow Families within ECE programmes. These findings have implications for ECE teachers' practice, particularly as teachers and teacher educators in many locations work to address issues of exclusion and bias and to create environments where children and their parents are welcomed and have a sense of belonging and inclusion.

AB  - Physical education (PE) has long been neglected throughout the individualized education programme (IEP) process. Parents often feel unprepared to advocate for PE services within the IEP process. Aim: Thus, the purpose of this study was to outline the development of an advocacy checklist to help parents address PE within the IEP process and to examine parents' experiences discussing PE during IEP meetings. A qualitative descriptive approach was used to drive interviews that were conducted with seven parents of children with visual impairments (VI). Three interrelated themes were constructed using an inductive category development approach: (1) 'It's [PE] basically a check mark, It's, he was there. He didn't go to sleep', (2) 'I'd say it's [PE] one of our most important pieces… we believe in as a family' and (3) 'This is a perfect checklist of what they [IEP team] need to be going over'. The current study revealed multiple barriers that intervene with appropriate documentation of PE services during the IEP meeting. As voiced by the parents in this study, the checklist outlined in this study offers a practical and user-friendly PE advocacy checklist to guide all parties on the IEP team towards making informed decisions regarding these services.

AB  - Background: Music is weaved within our cultures; it is ever-present within daily-life and can considerably influence our mood, well-being and relationships. This study explores parental perceptions of the role of music in the home-lives of children and young people with profound and multiple learning disabilities in the UK. It considers parental views of how listening to and making music can shape the mood and behaviours of their child and their relationship. Methods: Using a mixed-method explanatory sequential design and cross-sectional survey methodology, the study collected data from parents and carers of children and young people with profound and multiple learning disabilities. Data were collected from an online questionnaire (n = 48) followed by online one-to-one interviews (n = 10). Findings: Parents reported that children and young people with profound and multiple learning disabilities more frequently listen to music than make music within the home. They also stated that music is used for enjoyment, to support mood-regulation and to add structure to the lives of young people with profound and multiple learning disabilities. Parents finally reported that listening to music together helps families feel more connected and strengthened their relationships. Conclusion: This paper outlines the positive role music may have in the home lives of people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and their families.

AB  - This partnership-based study identified how many middle and high school students take care of parents, siblings, and grandparents at home, via student surveys across Rhode Island public schools (N = 48,508; 46% White non-Latinx; 21% Latinx; 47% girls). Further, we investigated how students' caregiving for family related to their school engagement, belonging, and emotional well-being. A sizable proportion of students reported caring for family for part (29%) or most of the day (7%). Girls and Black, Asian, Latinx, Native, and multiracial youth were more likely to care for family, compared to boys and White non-Latinx youth. Caregiving students from all demographics were more likely to experience intense sadness compared to noncaregivers, revealing a need to support caregiving youth in schools. In addition, caregiving girls reported lower levels of school engagement and school belonging. However, caregiving for part of the day was related to greater belonging among Black and Native youth.

An invitation to complete an online survey about their experiences was sent to a random sample of special education teachers. The responses from 38 participants addressed areas such as relationships and communication with families, technology integration, student success, student engagement, and the extent to which the mandates of students' Individualized Education Plans were able to be met. Many of the participants reported on both the challenges and successes they had with technology; this included some new teaching techniques and technologies that they planned to continue to use after returning to in-person instruction. While they dealt with a variety of challenges, the teachers' actions demonstrated professional competence and integrity during this period.

AB  - Parenthood is a unique turning point in women's careers. Mothers, but not fathers, experience large and persistent child penalties to earnings after the birth of their first child. Child penalties mainly result from three differences between mothers and fathers in response to childbearing: hours worked, labor market exit rates, and wages (Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard 2019). One possible explanation for these patterns is that the mental and physical strain of parenthood accrues more acutely to mothers, limiting their ability to perform on the job after having a child. Increased difficulty engaging in work may slow mothers' career advancement, driving longer-term gaps in earnings and labor force participation between mothers and fathers. In this paper, we explore whether physical ability to perform work tasks changes differently for mothers than for fathers after a first birth among service members in the U.S. Marine Corps. We estimate event study models around the first birth and include data on nonparents to estimate counterfactual trends. We find men's and women's physical performance drops after having a child. The effects for mothers are large and remain for at least two years, while for fathers, the declines are smaller and fade by their child's second birthday. Our findings provide a new angle on the child penalty literature, highlighting that changes to job performance for women in the immediate 24 months following a first birth could lead to long-term child penalties.

AB  - Family-school collaboration is a key component of practice within the field of School Psychology. Promoting an effective partnership between parents and educators can be difficult, as a variety of factors influence the quality of the relationship. Currently, no scale exists to measure constructs related to family-school collaboration in a practical manner. The current study sought to create a reliable measure to assess parents' perceptions about the practice of family-school collaboration by their child's school that could provide actionable steps to increase family-school collaboration. The Family-School Collaboration Inventory (FSCI) was created from a review of best practices in the field of school psychology. The survey was completed online by 304 participants (parents/caregivers of school-aged children) recruited through social media websites. A principal component analysis was completed and identified three factors comprising family-school collaboration: (1) Collaborative Communication of Standards and Services (CCSS), (2) Inclusive Partnership (IP), and (3) Disconnected Experience (DE). Limitations and future directions are discussed.

The quality of the school-family-hospital liaison and the promotion of social links between the child with cancer and his or her classmates appear to be central points. In France, the schooling of children with cancer is not frequently examined, and the teachers' experiences are never discussed. The aim of our study is to investigate the professional practices and experiences of French teachers in kindergarten and primary schools welcoming students with cancer, regarding international studies, to contribute to improving the handling of these children. By using an international survey based on the Delphi method as well as qualitative data, we investigated the point of view of 66 French teachers working in kindergarten and primary schools. Both methods highlight that strong collaboration with parents, the information provided by medical staff, and social connections with classmates constitute needs for interviewed teachers. In parallel, keeping a constant link with the children and their families, raising the awareness of peers, and providing personalized support to the survivor student appear to be major resources for these teachers. In terms of difficulties, both methods attest that teachers request training and more support to manage both survivor students' academic difficulties, peer awareness, and mutual understanding. Besides, qualitative results suggest a lack of efficiency in school-hospital liaison and in institutional support, which might be strengthened through standardization of the re-entry process and systematic monitoring of the school career of these children.

AB  - The present study examined the preparations made by 14 mothers to ensure that their children's education was unhampered during the COVID-19 crisis and ready for face-to-face classes when permitted. The study used a reflexive thematic analysis of the face-to-face interviews with participants belonging to low-income families living in the central Philippines whose children used printed modules as teaching materials provided by the school. The study generated three themes: "realizing the gaps" (realizing that in-person campus-based instruction is better because distant learning is not effective); "filling in the gaps" (taking the lead in teaching the child at home and assisted by family and community members) and "getting back on track" (preparing children for face-to-face classes against the COVID-19). The study showed how Filipino parents particularly mothers kept their children in school despite pandemic-induced uncertainties, economic scarcities and social inequalities. The desire driven by the perceived benefits derived from education brought out the pathways to resourcefulness. This study draws attention to equal opportunities for learning across socio-economic statuses and a more inclusive delivery of instruction during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Food insecurity poses a serious threat to children's development, but the mechanisms through which food insecurity undermines child development are far less clear. Specifically, food insecurity may influence children through its effect on parents' psychological well-being and parent--child interactions as a result, but past research on the role of parents is correlational and undermined by omitted variable bias. Using a partially rural, low-income sample of parents living in Pennsylvania (N = 272, 90% mother, M[subscript age] = 35) and their school-aged children (ages 4-11, 50% female) alongside daily measures of parent-reported food insecurity and parent and child mood and behavior, we examine how daily changes in food insecurity predict daily changes in parent and child well-being, and the extent to which food insecurity operates through parents to affect children. This method not only explores families' daily, lived experiences of food insecurity, but improves upon the methodological issues undermining past research. Findings indicate that food insecurity influences parent and child well-being on a daily basis, but that associations are stronger and sustain longer for parents than children. Further, parent mood and behavior partially explain the association between daily food insecurity and child mood and behavior, but food insecurity is also independently associated with child well-being. This study is the first to examine daily associations between food insecurity and parent and child well-being. Its implications for food assistance programs, policies, and the future of food insecurity research are discussed.

AB  - Little is known about how parents talk about autism with their autistic children, particularly among families in which both a parent and child are autistic. Using an online survey, we gathered quantitative and qualitative data from 34 autistic parents (most of whom had told their children about their diagnosis) to address this knowledge gap. There was considerable overlap between the views and experiences of the autistic parents in this study and the largely non-autistic parent samples in previous research. Specifically, parents emphasised the importance of being open and honest about the diagnosis, disclosing the diagnosis as early as possible, individualising discussions to children's needs and framing the diagnosis positively. There were, however, areas in which the views and experiences of the current sample differed from previous research on non-autistic samples. First, our sample of autistic parents outlined the benefits of their own experiential expertise, which they felt resulted in heightened understanding and empathy with their children. Second, our sample tended not to express concerns about disclosure potentially having a negative impact. Finally, our participants did not express a want or need for professional support with disclosure. Instead, they reported feeling well equipped to support their children using their own knowledge and lived experience.

AB  - This research captures early childhood educators' (ECEs') perspectives when communicating with families about their children's diverse gender expression. Since families and ECEs play a pivotal role in shaping young children's understandings of gender it is necessary to learn more about ECEs' communications with families. The data that informs this paper is derived from a qualitative research study that used semi-structured focus groups with 15 ECEs who work with young children, ages 3-5 years, at licensed early childhood centres in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The ECEs were invited to participate in two focus group sessions to discuss their experiences after recalling conversations with families whose children identify outside the traditional constructs of masculine boy/feminine girl. One central finding the ECEs observe is the displeasure fathers have when their sons engage in feminine interests, including the affective actions the fathers then take to remove stereotypically feminine coded activities from their sons' lives. This research highlights the need for ongoing early childhood education training on gender diversity to better support non-binary, transgender children, and children from 2SLGBTQIA+ families.

AB  - Latin American families' history and life experiences impact the priorities and values the families have for their children with disabilities. It may be beneficial for early intervention (EI) providers to explore and integrate Latin American families' backgrounds to improve EI services. We completed a qualitative interview study using a collective case study analysis to (a) learn about Latin American families' parenting values and (b) explore families' experiences with a statewide early intervention model. Three mothers with young children who had received EI services completed two interviews. We found that each family had unique histories, compositions, support networks, and priorities that impacted their experiences with a statewide coaching model. Families revealed how their funds of knowledge were, at times, integrated into the EI they received. Our study describes a valuable method of learning about Latin American families' cultural backgrounds so that EI providers may sustain families' cultures within the services they provide.

AB  - Using an emerging model of family engagement in higher education and the concept of parental role construction as a framework, this study presents the "Ley de la Vida" (Law of Life) process to explore how Latina/o immigrant parents experience their children's transition to higher education. Centered on the experiences of 15 parents of first-generation Latina/o students, the study illuminates how parental experiences of their children's transition and new learning ultimately shape their supportive behaviors. Findings suggest that parents interact with colleges and universities both directly and indirectly--as their children transition to a college context, their own identities as parents transition and they re-construct their parental roles. This transition is conflicting for parents--while they are extremely proud of their children for going to college, they also experience frustration, sadness, and depression. Findings have important implications for the potential of institutions and families to work together to improve the academic outcomes of first-generation Latina/o undergraduate students.

AB  - This study aims to develop a more fully theorised concept of biocitizenship as part of the teaching of intersex in critical approaches to sex education. It advances a perspective in which the options of students, as future parents and as biocitizens, are not limited to compliance to biomedicine, but one in which formal education experiences might prepare them to be neighbours and parents who, as allies of intersex family/community members, can engage in political activism to effect change where deemed necessary. Data take the form of classroom talk drawn from a study based in an Aotearoa/New Zealand secondary school, focusing on transgressive acts of citizenship by an intersex activist visiting the sex education classroom and assisting students with social justice projects. Transcripts of audio-recorded classroom interactions are analysed using a version of critical discourse analysis that directs attention to semiotic modes such as visual cues of bodies as well as affect. Findings reveal that biocitizenship can also include those who accept intersex bodies, altering established practices to accommodate those bodies and the people who live them.

AB  - This article discusses family language policy and the tensions between mothers' and children's language beliefs in two Vietnamese immigrant families in Melbourne. These tensions have frequently been discussed from the parental perspective, but it is less common to include the children's voice. We draw on a larger in-depth qualitative study of family language policy in Vietnamese families living in Australia to explore the language beliefs of both children and adults. Employing Fitzsimmons-Doolan's [2018. "Language Ideology Change Over Time: Lessons for Language Policy in the U.S. State of Arizona and Beyond." "TESOL Quarterly" 52 (1): 34-61. doi:10.1002/tesq.371] notions of pro-multilingual and pro-monolingual ideologies and Bourdieu's [1986. "The Forms of Capital." In "Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education", edited by J. G. Richardson, 241-258. Greenwood Press] concept of capital, we explore family language policy from the perspectives of both children and their mothers, and show how these perspectives are associated with each other. Findings reveal the pro-monolingual stance of the children in opposition to the pro-multilingual stance of their mothers where the children and their mothers appeared to attach different degrees of value to English and Vietnamese. The findings reinforce the complexities in realising family language policy across languages.

AB  - The current study explored factors influencing career choices of Asian American social workers and assessed if their personal characteristics and career-related experiences affected their perceived glass ceiling, perception of ethnic discrimination, and perception of career prospects. A total of 208 Asian American social work administrators, supervisors, practitioners and graduate social work students participated in a comprehensive online survey. Participants provided basic demographic and career-related information and completed a set of measures to explore their reasons of choosing social work as their career, and their career perceptions and prospects. Correlation analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors of their perception of ethnic discrimination, perceived glass ceiling, and perception of career prospects. The findings showed that altruistic reasons were very important to extremely important in their choice of social work as their career. Social work idealism was found to associate positively with both altruistic reasons and professional concerns of choosing social work. There was a significant relationship between participant's immigration status and family influence on their career choice. Those who were not born in the U.S. were more likely to be influenced by their family in their career choice than those who were born in the U.S. Those whose parents were not born in the U.S. were more likely to be influenced by their family expectations on their career choice than those either of their parents was born in the U.S. Perception of organizational fairness was found to be a strong predictor of perceived glass ceiling, perception of ethnic discrimination, and perception of career prospects. Implications of the findings for social work education and future research were discussed.

AB  - Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a core component of special education for many children with learning disabilities and/or autism who have minimal or no speech. Much literature focuses on implementation of AAC in the classroom or therapy setting, but less is known about how AAC is used in the family home. Few studies are authored by an AAC parent/researcher with reflection on positionality, power and the advantages conferred by 'insider' status. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the perspectives of five families of minimally verbal children on the place of AAC in their child's home communication. Semi-structured family interviews were transcribed and subjected to Thematic Analysis. Formal AAC practices such as Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and Makaton were found to play a limited role in the children's home communication. Findings indicate three possible explanations: the emotional and relationship-building dimensions of family communication; the competing priorities of family life with a disabled child; and the child's existing multimodal communication strategies including the use of household objects. These findings offer a preliminary starting point for understanding the emic perspectives of AAC families and reasons for their convergence/divergence with professional attitudes to AAC, and warrant further investigation in larger-scale studies.

AB  - The unprecedented Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected adolescents' routines, experiences, and physical and mental health but not everybody reacted in the same way. The present longitudinal mixed-method study based in Luxembourg explores adolescents' emotional responses to the pandemic as well as resilience factors that helped them cope with the challenges. It combines data from a survey completed in 2021 by 332 adolescents and from interviews carried out with 19 adolescents in 2020 and 2021. Overall, the results document the importance of support through family and peer relationships in order to withstand adversity. The findings may help parents, educators, and policymakers develop a supportive environment that minimizes the consequences of future negative events on adolescents.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its policy responses have had a detrimental effect on millions of people's mental health. Here, we investigate its impact on autistic people and their families using qualitative methods. Specifically, we addressed: how did autistic people experience an increase in social isolation during the initial lockdown? And how was their mental health impacted by lockdown? Autistic and non-autistic researchers conducted 144 semi-structured interviews with autistic adults (n = 44), parents of autistic children (n = 84) including autistic parents and autistic young people (n = 16). We deployed thematic analysis to identify key themes. The enhanced social isolation accompanying the pandemic had a serious and damaging impact on autistic people's mental health and subjective wellbeing. They spoke of intensely missing friends and more incidental forms of social connection. They also reported intense dissatisfaction with the substitution of embodied, person-to-person connection in health services by online/telephone-based alternatives, sometimes accompanied by serious negative consequences. These findings reveal the fundamental importance of supporting autistic people to maintain direct and incidental social contact during the pandemic and beyond. They speak against established theories that downplay autistic people's need for human connection and the extent to which they have been affected by social isolation during lockdowns.

AB  - Objective: This scoping review aimed to map the extent of evidence on parental advocacy programmes supporting participation in child welfare decision-making. Introduction: Though parental advocacy programmes aim to empower parents navigating complex child welfare systems, the breadth of evidence has not yet been synthesised. Inclusion criteria: Literature from 2002-2022 on parental advocacy programmes related to child welfare decision-making, encompassing various models. Methods: Academic databases, grey literature, and reference lists were searched in September 2022. Screening and data extraction utilised standardised forms. Analysis: incorporated summary and thematic methods. Results: 57 studies were included, exhibiting a predominance of qualitative methods. Peer advocacy was the most common model. The review reveals a proliferation of peer support initiatives aiming to enhance parental empowerment through shared experiences. Conclusions: Parental advocacy programmes demonstrate promise for improving family experiences and participation in child welfare systems. However, more rigorous evaluation is needed to elucidate the connections between specific programmes elements and outcomes. The review maps the current evidence landscape, while underscoring the need for implementation research and inclusive participation paradigms.

AB  - This study analyses student and parental perspectives on the decision to drop out from a rural junior high school in northeast China. Data were collected in 2017 via participant observation, focus groups with students who were considered at "high risk of dropping out", and semi-structured interviews with parents. The official Chinese dropout rate during the nine years of compulsory education is 6.2%; however, in this case, the cumulative dropout rate was as high as 43.1%. Beyond analysing the poor education environment, low academic performance, and pressures from private tutoring, migrant families' situations were also examined for a deeper understanding of the motivations of dropouts and their parents. Official discourse in China blames high dropout rates on students' "study-weariness"; however, this study suggests that, given the intense competitiveness of the country's education system and the disadvantages of rural residents, dropping out may seem a rational choice for many rural families.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate the collaboration processes of immigrant families as they search for online information together. Immigrant English-language learning adults of lower socioeconomic status often work collaboratively with their children to search the internet. Family members rely on each other's language and digital literacy skills in this collaborative process known as online search and brokering (OSB). While previous work has identified ecological factors that impact OSB, research has not yet distilled the specific learning processes behind such collaborations. Design/methodology/approach: For this study, the authors adhere to practices of a case study examination. This study's participants included parents, grandparents and children aged 10-17 years. Most adults were born in Mexico, did not have a college-degree, worked in service industries and represented a lower-SES population. This study conducted two to three separate in-home family visits per family with interviews and online search tasks. Findings: From a case study analysis of three families, this paper explores the funds of knowledge, resilience, ecological support and challenges that children and parents face, as they engage in collaborative OSB experiences. This study demonstrates how in-home computer-supported collaborative processes are often informal, social, emotional and highly relevant to solving information challenges. Research limitations/implications: An intergenerational OSB process is different from collaborative online information problem-solving that happens between classroom peers or coworkers. This study's research shows how both parents and children draw on their funds of knowledge, resilience and ecological support systems when they search collaboratively, with and for their family members, to problem solve. This is a case study of three families working in collaboration with each other. This case study informs analytical generalizations and theory-building rather than statistical generalizations about families. Practical implications: Designers need to recognize that children and youth are using the same tools as adults to seek high-level critical information. This study's model suggests that if parents and children are negotiating information seeking with the same technology tools but different funds of knowledge, experience levels and skills, the presentation of information (e.g. online search results, information visualizations) needs to accommodate different levels of understanding. This study recommends designers work closely with marginalized communities through participatory design methods to better understand how interfaces and visuals can help accommodate youth invisible work. Social implications: The authors have demonstrated in this study that learning and engaging in family online searching is not only vital to the development of individual and digital literacy skills, it is a part of family learning. While community services, libraries and schools have a responsibility to support individual digital and information literacy development, this study's model highlights the need to recognize funds of knowledge, family resiliency and asset-based learning. Schools and teachers should identify and harness youth invisible work as a form of learning at home. The authors believe educators can do this by highlighting the importance of information problem solving in homes and youth in their families. Libraries and community centers also play a critical role in supporting parents and adults for technical assistance (e.g. WiFi access) and information resources. Originality/value: This study's work indicates new conditions fostering productive joint media engagement (JME) around OSB. This study contributes a generative understanding that promotes studying and designing for JME, where family responsibility is the focus.

AB  - Background/Context: Despite research that has rebutted the tiger parent stereotype, the perception that Asian immigrant parents enact overly strict and controlling educational practices continues to be widespread and entrenched. This stereotype is problematic because it constrains the understanding of Asian Americans to a one-dimensional group and engenders a false narrative of Asian American educational success as expected. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Using an intersectional lens, this study interrogates the stereotype of Asian immigrant parents as tiger parents. We examine how one subgroup of Asian American youth-lower income Chinese American adolescents (children of Chinese immigrants) spoke about their parents' involvement in their schooling and educational expectations. Our aim is to center young people's explanations to explore how they perceive parental educational socialization and whether it conforms to notions of tiger parenting. We posed the following three specific research questions: (1) How do these students speak about and understand the ways in which their parents monitor their schoolwork? (2) How do these students describe and understand their parents' messaging of educational expectations? and (3) In what ways do these students depict parent-child communication in their families? Research Design: Participants were 32 ninth-grade low-income Chinese American children of immigrants. We conducted individual interviews focused on educational socialization in the home. We used a combination of inductive and theoretically driven thematic analysis and explored the extent to which students' perspectives of their parents converged or diverged with the tiger parent stereotype. We adopted a working definition of tiger parenting based on categories related to parenting, including close monitoring of schoolwork, perceptions of high parent expectations for school performance and educational/career attainment, and parent-initiated communications regarding children's academic lives and decisions. Findings/Results: Our analysis revealed that participants did not experience their parents' educational involvement as conforming to the tiger parent stereotype. Instead, students were largely self-directed and described their parents as exercising basic monitoring of schoolwork, conveying generic and pragmatic educational and career expectations, and trusting their children overall to manage schoolwork and share key school-related information as needed. We introduce a concept that we call "informed distance" as more salient for understanding our participants' experiences. Conclusions/Recommendations: Educators must interrupt the tiger parent and model minority stereotypes to make room for a fuller and more complex understanding of Asian American students' experiences and ensure their educational needs are equitably addressed. Teachers and counselors can play an affirmative role in educational guidance for Chinese American students.

AB  - As linguistic diversity increases in the U.S., it is essential for pre-kindergarten (pre-k) programs to expand their capacity to serve families whose home languages are not English. Family engagement is a key component of early childhood education; however, it is unclear whether family engagement practices uniformly benefit students from diverse backgrounds, including English Language Learners (ELL). In this mixed methods study, we explored whether teachers' family engagement practices were associated with ELL children's attendance and early learning, focusing on whether two aspects of the linguistic context--classroom composition of ELL students and teachers' practices for communicating in families' home languages--moderates these associations. Additionally, we used parent focus groups to shed light on ELL families' experiences with family engagement. We found consistent evidence that associations between teachers' family engagement practices and ELL children's attendance and socioemotional skills were moderated by classroom composition of ELL students. Specifically, family engagement practices were associated with better attendance and higher socioemotional skills among ELL children in minority ELL classrooms (less than 20% ELL) but not in classrooms with more ELL students (20% or more). Results aligned with themes from our qualitative analysis, which found that having few ELL families in the classroom made it difficult for ELL parents to make connections with other families, which might make it challenging to build a sense of community. This suggests that families without access to networks of linguistically similar peers at school might need additional support from teachers to feel welcome and encouraged to participate.

AB  - Many families seek quality, inclusive care for their young children with disabilities. A key to successful inclusion is understanding the needs of families and professionals who serve them. This review examined literature about the inclusion of young children with disabilities in childcare programs and collaboration among early childhood professionals from the perspectives of parents and professionals. Twenty-five studies were selected through searches of online databases, leading researchers, and journals on the topic. Study participants included childcare providers across all program types, special educators, specialized therapists, and parents. Topics addressed included professionals' experiences of inclusion and collaboration, factors that influenced these experiences, quality of care for young children with disabilities, and parental decisions regarding childcare. The results indicated that more research is needed specific to infants and toddlers with disabilities in childcare settings as well as the experiences of parents and providers. This greater understanding would bridge the gaps between policy, research, and practice.

AB  - Background: As life expectancy for people with an intellectual disability increases, there is a growing cohort of older father carers. This study aimed to gain a more in-depth understanding of older father carers' experiences of parenting. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 7 older fathers (M = 63.9 years) and analysed using constructivist grounded theory. Results: Three conceptual categories were identified. "Wearing different hats: how fathers' sense of identity had altered over the years. "Family comes first": importance placed on the family unit. "Getting on in years": the challenges faced by ageing fathers parenting their son/daughter. Conclusions: Fathers re-evaluated their priorities and found a new identity in their parenting role, although they continued to see themselves as secondary carers. Fathers worried about the future as their health declined but drew strength from the benefits they had derived and the challenges that they had overcome to do their best for their son/daughter and their family.

AB  - Objective: Community colleges, which can lead students to job opportunities and well-paying careers, are one of the main entry points to higher education for student parents. We use a conceptual framework that bridges career capital and community cultural wealth to understand student parents' college and career trajectories. This study asks (a) How do student parents of color navigate community college? (b) How do student parents of color make educational and career decisions?, and (c) What, if any, institutional resources do student parents of color utilize to learn about career planning and workforce transition resources at their campus? Method: This qualitative case study draws from individual and focus group interviews with 67 student parents of color to better understand how they tap into their cultural knowledge and lived experiences to navigate college and make career decisions. Results: Data speaks to (a) student parents' difficulty maneuvering life as a college student and parent; and (b) the importance of students' familial and institutional support networks as they seek college and career information. Contributions: We hope these findings will encourage community colleges to (re)consider their current practices relating to the student parent population which includes identifying and tracking student parents, implementing guided pathways with their unique needs in mind, communicating services offered to student parents, and creating a more welcoming environment for students and their families.

AB  - Research Findings: Various cross-disciplinary STEM learning activities were implemented in the early childhood context. Young children and their parents had rather positive attitudes towards STEM learning. In addition to educational values, the economic value of STEM learning for their family was perceived by a good number of parents, which believed that learning STEM could pave a path for their children toward future economic prosperity. Early childhood teachers perceived the values of STEM education from the learning and social perspectives while they realized various practical constrains of time, support and resources, worried about teachers' capacity and subject knowledge, and considered students, developmental differences and safety. They were not confident to implement STEM lessons with their young students. Practice or Policy: It is urgent to present teachers a holistic picture for STEM curriculum in the EC context, covering strengthening discipline-based content learning, enhancing discipline-based integration, and preparing for the innovation-driven integration. The complete process of transferring professional knowledge (including awareness, acquisition, transformation, association, application, and externalization) should be embodied in the design of STEM professional training programs. Parents also needed more training on how to work with their children in STEM activities and scaffold their children' learning.

AB  - While the COVID-19 pandemic challenged educators, parents, and students to adapt to online learning, it significantly impacted Asian Americans, especially the Chinese immigrant families, with increased anti-Asian acts of racism and xenophobia. The case study investigated a Chinese immigrant family's experiences transitioning to online learning in the climate of anti-Chinese rhetoric in the United States. The case comprised a Chinese immigrant woman and her twins, a boy, and a girl, who were middle school students in a Northern California school district that transitioned to online learning in March 2020. Narrative interviews were conducted online and via telephone and analyzed using content analysis. The findings indicated the challenges in engaging students in online learning that impacted their interactions with classmates and their learning experiences. The findings also revealed the family's coping mechanisms for dealing with anti-Asian discrimination and prejudice against Chinese immigrants, an issue that the twin's school, teacher, and classmates seem to have ignored, according to their accounts. These mechanisms were grounded in their Chinese culture and parental involvement styles. The study emphasizes the need to educate teachers on the use of technology and online teaching to middle school students, the value of Chinese parental involvement in their children's education, and the dangers of bias, discrimination, and microaggressions to promote inclusive classrooms. The results will benefit the development of online teaching and learning and touch upon students' diversity, policy makers' strategies, and the quality of the learning environment.

AB  - Latinx immigrant parents indicated that the type of pedagogical practices they prefer or value for their children's education in early childhood classrooms emphasize opportunities for children to help each other, collaborate and contribute, make choices and take responsibility in their learning. In a study using video-cued ethnography, parents indicated that they believe that children need these meaningful experiences to be part of society and "convivencia." The parents' preferred pedagogical practices align with facets of the Learning by Observing and Pitching In to family and community endeavours. [Translation from English by Mercè Rius.]

AB  - The social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic have challenged many aspects of preschool everyday life. Particularly vulnerable to these restrictions is the aspect of introducing new children to preschool, since preschool introduction constitutes a natural arena for establishment of preschool staff's relationships with children and their parents. Based on analysis of open-ended survey data (N = 465), the present study explores how Swedish preschool staff has experienced and dealt with the pandemic restrictions during preschool introduction. Our qualitative analysis resulted in three categories and six subcategories, including results demonstrating that social distancing-restrictions accentuate the importance of engaging relationally with the families, while simultaneously constituting a disconcerting complication since the physical distance constrains the important relationship-building between staff and parents. Moreover, the children seem to interpret the parent-staff physical distance as relational distance, which negatively affects their emerging relationship to preschool staff. Our results also show that how parental participation is organised during preschool introduction may be of critical importance for staff-child relational establishment, providing insights for researchers and practitioners in the field valuable to consider also in a non-pandemic context.

AB  - In this study, northern Canadian rural and Indigenous parents provided valuable information about the self-initiated writing that their two- through nine-year-old children do at home. In interview responses, participating parents told stories about the writing materials and spaces they make available to children for writing. They talked about how they support their children's writing: informally--by demonstrating that writing is important; and formally--through direct teaching of letter forms and sound-letter relationships. Parents provided examples of their children's self-initiated writing, which includes types of texts that are not usually valued in mainstream spaces such as school. They explained that the writing is usually for the purposes of expressing feelings and informing family members. Our study adds to the literature on family literacy practices by validating the knowledge and experiences that northern rural and Indigenous children bring to their formal schooling. Recommendations for teachers include initiating conversations with parents about the writing that their children do at home, finding spaces in the classroom schedule for children to present and talk about their self-initiated writing with the class, and providing specific information about how parents can support their children's writing. A "Tips for Parents" sheet is provided.

AB  - American Indian youth experience teen birth and school dropout at higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Early childbearing is associated with adverse health and socioeconomic outcomes, including attenuated education. However, kinship childrearing norms among Northern Plains tribes can support positive experiences of early childbearing. Using a community based participatory research framework, this mixed methods exploratory study engaged high school students from a Northern Plains reservation community to examine youth perceptions of family support and belief in ability to stay in school should they have a child. We elicited youth observations of facilitators and inhibitors to academic achievement for young parents. This research supports the need for strengths-based, gender specific, and family inclusive sexuality education to support young people in their reproductive choices in reservation settings. We highlight the utility of including youth as coauthors and co-researchers in future studies.

AB  - Background and Aims: Survey research indicates that autistic children and young people experienced high levels of anxiety and isolation during lockdowns in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Meanwhile, qualitative studies suggest that there may have been some benefits in the switch to home learning for this population. However, the majority of evidence to date comes from parent reports; the current study aimed to triangulate the perspectives of autistic youth and their parents in order to more fully understand the impact of periods of lockdown on education, relationships, and wellbeing. Methods: Thirteen semistructured interviews were conducted (six with adolescents, seven with parents) to explore the experiences of a group of autistic youth aged 13-14 years (Year 9 of mainstream education in England) during a period of intermittent lockdown. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Two broad themes capturing commonality and diversity in the adolescents' experiences of lockdown were developed. (1) "Different stress, not less stress" encapsulates the finding that, despite the enforced removal from the school environment providing short-term relief, new stressors contributed to consistently high levels of anxiety for the young people throughout lockdown periods. Stressors included managing home-school within the family unit, navigating time without boundaries, and anxiety about the virus. (2) "A shrunken world" reflects the heightened impact of losing access to meaningful social relationships, extracurricular pursuits, and health-promoting activities for autistic youth. Discussion: The early stages of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused serious disruption to education for many children and young people globally; our findings provide further evidence that the impact was particularly salient for autistic youth in terms of social isolation, lost learning, and heightened anxiety. Implications: These findings underscore the necessity of long-term support for the education, social needs, and mental health of autistic young people in the aftermath of lockdowns in response to COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic impacted school-based delivery of special educational supports and therapeutic services. This study describes student receipt of school-based supports/services and parent satisfaction by instruction modalities during the 2020-2021 academic year in the United States. Data were collected through the COVID Experiences Survey from parents of children ages 5-12 years, administered using NORC's AmeriSpeak panel. Most parents reported satisfaction with supports (88.4%) and services (93.2%). Dissatisfaction with special education supports and therapeutic services was more common among parents whose children received supports/ services virtually than in person (special educational supports: aOR=12.00, 95% CI [1.49-96.89], p=0.020; therapeutic services: aOR=15.76, 95% CI [1.01-245.40], p=0.049). These findings suggest opportunities to improve design and delivery of online special education supports and therapeutic services as well as emergency preparedness by considering the needs of students with disabilities and their families.

AB  - This article reports on a study carried out in Newfoundland, Canada, which investigated how homework practices were experienced by families of eight-year-old children, and their siblings, and their parents. It documents, through institutional ethnography, how educational discourse transferred from schools to homes subsequently shaped everyday family life. It explores the demands and expectations that homework places on families and how different families experience homework differently; often creating frustrations and tensions depending on the resources available. It shows the various forms of cultural capital needed in order to carry out homework practices and how the lack of capital may contribute to frustrations in different households. All families in this study struggled with educational discourse related to homework, at one time or another, during their child's educational trajectory.

AB  - Beyond Words: Engaging Young Children and Families in Gallery Education at Tate Liverpool, is a three-year ethnographic case study that explores what happens when preschool children, parents and nursery practitioners from a Sure Start Children's Centre, visit Tate to participate in an extended series of gallery visits and workshops with artists. This article explores the potential value and tensions of those creative and cultural experiences, particularly for young children and families, by critically examining different perspectives, discourses and possible constructs of effective creative engagement. This research contributes to the debate on ways of engaging children and families from marginalised communities in cultural visits and creative practices by opening up existing discussions on poverty, matters of inclusion, negative stereotypes and dominant educational discourses. Insights from parents are included and their feelings are related to the 'symbolic violence' often felt by parents and children throughout their education from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This research explores how Tate Liverpool developed relationships with a diverse family audience, through developing relationships with children and adults over repeated visits, as an important way for offering continuity and a sense of belonging, particularly for families who may not traditionally visit art galleries. In doing so, it makes a case for galleries to be considered as democratic, inclusive and rhizomatic learning environments, where artist educators act as 'dreamkeepers'. Dreamkeepers can offer the space for extra emotional, social and intellectual support needed for healing from educational injury and for restarting a learning journey.

AB  - Parent-implemented interventions (PIIs) hold promise for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families. Yet, reports of parent and family perceptions regarding PIIs are limited. The present study's purpose was to gain parent perceptions regarding the helpful and challenging intervention components and contextual factors in the implementation of one PII in their daily lives. Six interviews were conducted and analyzed using an exploratory qualitative approach. Findings included considerable parent satisfaction with intervention experiences, particularly related to the use of videos taken of themselves and their children during intervention sessions. Some parents voiced discouragement after watching video examples, and parents reported challenges finding time to implement the intervention. Parents valued the supportive relationship formed with their interventionist. Additional findings and implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Paying for college expenses can be stressful for anyone, regardless of citizenship status. Asian American students and their parents may be negotiating with each other who will shoulder these expenses, while international Asian students often enter this country with their parents' financial support already established. This is the first study to specifically examine a large sample of Asian college students (n = 671) and explore how parents influence Asian students' financial attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors through a family financial socialization theoretical lens. Results show that financial socialization is positively associated with financial behaviors for all Asian college students. Findings are informative for college counselors, financial advisors, educators, and clinicians who work with Asian students and their parents.

AB  - Recent developments in the acculturation literature have emphasized the importance of adopting "intergroup perspectives" that provide a valuable background for investigating how acculturation orientations (i.e., maintenance of the culture of origin and the adoption of the destination culture) of adolescents from migrant families are embedded in their proximal socialization contexts. Accordingly, we sought to understand the combined effects of the perceived parents' acculturation orientations and classmates' acculturation preferences on adolescents' own acculturation orientations in two independent cultural contexts, namely North-East of Italy (Study I) and South-East of Turkey (Study II). Participants were 269 (53.2% female; M[subscript age] = 14.77) and 211 (71.1% female; M[subscript age] = 15.37) adolescents from migrant families in Italy and in Turkey, respectively. Findings indicated that adolescents' acculturation orientations were influenced by their perceptions of both parents' acculturation orientations and classmates' acculturation preferences. In addition, the effects of parents' adoption of the destination culture were stronger than the effects of classmates' preferences for adoption of the destination culture in both countries. However, the effects of parents' maintenance of the culture of origin were stronger than the effects of classmates' preferences for maintaining the culture of origin in Turkey, but not in Italy.

AB  - Asian immigrant parents raising children with developmental disabilities experience frustration, stress, social isolation, and poor health outcomes. Based on data collected from 55 Chinese American parents of children with developmental disabilities, this study examined the relationships between individual characteristics, parents' perceptions of developmental disability, social support, severity of disability, and parents' self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. The findings showed that Chinese American parents exhibited different pathways for better health outcomes. Overall social support, specific support from family and friends/co-workers, and community involvement were significant correlates of maternal self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. Fear of stigmatization was significantly and positively associated with maternal depressive symptoms. Similarly, education and employment status correlated with paternal self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. The ages of parents and their children were found to be negatively correlated with paternal depressive symptoms. The child's disability severity level was not associated with parents' self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. The findings also confirmed that parents' self-reported physical health status was significantly and negatively associated with their own depressive symptoms. Chinese American mothers experienced poor physical health and greater depressive symptoms compared to Chinese American fathers. The study's clinical implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - This mixed-methods study aimed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of involving early childhood education (ECE) staff without special education training or prior parent coaching experience in the delivery of an adapted evidence-based parent coaching intervention for young children with autism (Focused Playtime Intervention-Preschool, FPI-P). Ten staff members of a university-affiliated, inclusive ECE program were trained to deliver parent coaching procedures during temporary classroom closures due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Child participants included nine preschool students with ASD aged between 34 and 52 months. While findings highlight several opportunities for improving FPI-P staff training and implementation procedures, results demonstrate (a) the feasibility of involving ECE staff in the delivery of ASD-specific parent coaching to promote social communication, (b) that both parents and preschool staff viewed the experience as beneficial for themselves and the child, and (c) that parents perceived the program to be aligned with family-centered intervention principles.

AB  - Significant disparities exist between Hispanic and non-Hispanic families in time-to-diagnosis among children identified as at risk of autism spectrum disorder; yet, little is known about parent experiences throughout the diagnostic process that may contribute to or help explain these disparities. The current study examined longitudinal trajectories of parenting stress, coping, and perceived family impact during the autism spectrum disorder diagnostic process among an ethnically and racially diverse low-income, urban sample, allowing for comparisons between Hispanic and non-Hispanic families. Hispanic families reported lower levels of parenting stress (X[superscript 2] = 5.35(1), p = 0.021), avoidant (X[superscript 2] = 9.66(1), p = 0.002) and approach (X[superscript 2] = 8.61(1), p = 0.003) coping, and negative family impact (X[superscript 2] = 5.39(1), p = 0.020) across time (main effects) compared with non-Hispanic families. Furthermore, there were differences in the change in use (Time Period x Ethnicity interaction effects) of both avoidant (X[superscript 2] = 10.80(3), p = 0.013) and approach (X[superscript 2] = 11.57(3), p = 0.009) coping, as well as negative family impact (X[superscript 2] = 9.81(3), p = 0.020), between Hispanic and non-Hispanic parents over time. These differences begin to shed light on the unique experiences of Hispanic parents. Because of the strengths that Hispanic families demonstrate, interventions that leverage those strengths and focus on education, empowerment, and resilience might be particularly beneficial for Hispanic families and may also better inform work to increase resilience in non-Hispanic families.

AB  - This study aims to explore the overlapping influences of the home and school on peer victimization in adolescents under the notion of home-school partnership and to investigate how the parent-child relationship, teacher-student relationship, teenage depressive symptoms are related to peer victimization by constructing a moderated mediation model. It surveyed 1,710 students in 5-8 grades, using the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (brief version), Multidimensional Peer Victimization Scale, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (brief version). Research findings show that the parent-child relationship had a direct impact on peer victimization and indirectly affected peer victimization via the mediation of teenage depressive symptoms; and that teacher-student relationships had moderating effects on the three paths in the mediation model, playing roles in enhancing the protection effect of the parent-child relationship against peer victimization, weakening the possible impact of the parent-child relationship on teenager depression, and alleviating the predictive effect of depressive symptoms on peer victimization. The research suggests that home-school partnership is a viable avenue for the prevention of school bullying.

AB  - This qualitative case study explores the intersection of family literacy, bilingualism, and critical media literacy by examining how mother-child conversations about children's videos helped preschool, bilingual children develop critical perspectives on gender roles. As part of a larger qualitative study, this study focused on 4-year-old, Korean-descent children's conversations with their mothers about gender representations in children's videos as well as in their drawing. The data were collected over three months through multiple sources, including observations, interviews, and children's artifacts. The findings of this study suggest that critical media literacy practices can be used in bilingual households as a tool to enrich family literacy environments in which mother and child explore gender representations in children's media in an interactive and critical way.

AB  - School infiltration is an important aspect of family parenting research in recent years. This study reexamines the evaluation mechanism of higher education access path to explore the feelings of schooling winners (also Gaokao winners). Different from stratified education's understanding of family authority, this study proposes to deconstruct the rough understanding of stratified type, presenting a more historical and life-sense process of education acquisition and family parenting mode permeated by school education. This paper mainly uses the method of narrative analysis to explore the family parenting experiences of eight successful participants in higher education. The study found that Chinese family parenting was heavily influenced by schooling. Through discipline, empathy, and home-school cooperation, families reinforce the ideals and goals of schooling (high scores) in the field outside the school. Thus, participants expressed negative views and feelings about teachers, classmates and families. After completing the admission examination of higher education, some participants take the initiative to try to repair the relationship and adjust themselves to reach a reconciliation; Others are still growing up in the distressing experience.

When teachers have a positive perception of minority parent involvement, they are more willing to take initiative toward helping the minority parents. A quantitative approach was taken in this study with the use of a researcher developed instrument. All the 30 teachers of a minority school in Hong Kong participated in the study. Results of data analysis indicated that teachers perceived minority parents not contributing enough to helping their children's study. Teachers indicated that they were willing to work with minority parents to get them involved in education However, the teachers admitted that they need to do more on their parts too.

AB  - This article shares helpful, research-backed ways that parents can support minority languages in their children's lives. Many parents around the world face language struggles, including losing heritage languages to the community language or trying to support a foreign language to increase future opportunities. For example, parents in Mexico may want to encourage their children to speak Náhuatl with older family members, but the children prefer Spanish due to its widespread use and status in the community. This same family may encourage their children to study English in order to increase future employment and travel opportunities. However, asking children to become bi- or even trilingual can feel like a time-intensive, stressful, and expensive task. It doesn't have to be a negative experience, though! This article provides tips and strategies, both theoretical and practical, for encouraging minority language study and use in the household, touching on aspects of bilingualism such as literacy, inter-sibling language use, technology, and cost-cutting measures. Families from all over the globe and of any size can utilize this information to encourage bilingualism or multilingualism in their families.

AB  - There is a lack of measures that reflect the intervention priorities of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and that assess the impact of interventions on family experience and quality of life. The Autism Family Experience Questionnaire (AFEQ) was developed through focus groups and online consultation with parents, and reflected parental priorities. It was then administered to the parents of children enrolled in the Pre-school Autism Communication Trial and its 6-year follow-up study. The AFEQ showed good convergent validity with well-established measures of child adaptive functioning, parental mental health and parental wellbeing. It was sensitive to change in response to a parent-mediated intervention for young children with autism, showing treatment effect at treatment endpoint which increased at six-year follow-up.

AB  - For decades, educational research has focused on centering the experiences of children of color. From this research arose culturally relevant pedagogies (CRPs) and culturally sustaining pedagogies (CSPs). However, as countless teachers focus on developing more inclusive classroom practices, the cultural needs of parents continue to be ignored. One reason for this is that, while being manifestations of funds of knowledge, CRP and CSP are rooted in the classroom and not the home. As such, there is a need for culturally sustaining research that supports/affirms parents. This article presents how testimonios gathered in Spanish with Spanish-dominant mothers serve as counter-narratives to research that positions them as disengaged. The article also features the ways in which mothers subvert attempts to minimize their parental presence. A preliminary framework for culturally sustaining research is also shared. Participants included 10 Spanish-dominant Latinx mothers from a large immigrant community in New York City. Mothers qualified for inclusion if their child (a) attended a local public elementary school, (b) was in Grades 2 to 6, (c) was classified as having a disability, and (d) was classified as an English language learner by their school. Qualifying children were receiving services in one of three special education settings: bilingual inclusive classrooms, transitional bilingual special education, or monolingual inclusive education. This study employed a combination of qualitative research methods and consisted of two phases. During the first phase, 10 mothers took part in two narrative interviews. For the second phase, three focal mothers, chosen from the larger sample, took part in ethnographic case studies consisting of five additional interviews, two home observations, one communal recollection, and sharing of artifacts. (a) Mothers of emergent bilinguals labeled as disabled (MoEBLADs) are systematically excluded from their child's education at both the school and district levels. (b) MoEBLADs internalize these experiences and fault themselves for their limited participation in their children's learning. (c) MoEBLADs subversively make space for themselves in their children's educational experiences by focusing on contributions they can make outside of school. Research about MoEBLADs typically frames them as unwilling to support and/or incapable of supporting their children academically, signaling that many of the deficit-grounded perspectives MoEBLADs encounter in schools are also present in research. Researchers must address how the language of research contributes to the reinforcement and maintenance of deficit-grounded perspectives calling for a need to shift from inclusive research to culturally sustaining research.

AB  - There is a paucity of studies that center on the lived experiences of Black families raising autistic children, and major gaps remain in our understanding of how parents of Black autistic children cope with stressors. Drawing from the Black family stress and coping model, this mixed-methods study explored coping strategies utilized by parents of Black autistic children. Twenty-two parents completed the "Ways of Coping Questionnaire" and participated in semi-structured interviews. Using grounded theory methods, we conducted data collection and analyses simultaneously until we did not identify new themes. Our quantitative and qualitative results were generally aligned. We found that parents used an array of coping strategies, at times combining different methods, to address complex stressors. Parents also expressed the need for more social support from providers, as well as a desire for inclusive spaces where they could engage with other parents whom they felt could better relate to the stressors they encountered. Study findings also suggest that kinship support, church involvement, and collective socialization are key protective factors in Black communities. Therefore, understanding the role culture plays in the use and effectiveness of coping strategies is essential to improving healthcare and other systems of care.

AB  - This study investigated the role of acceptance during the transition process among autistic young adults, parents, and practitioners. Six focus groups were run and thematic analysis was used to identify four themes: Youth on the autism spectrum discussed transition as a time where "Self-Advocacy and Self-Acceptance" were salient. Both youth and parents discussed the "Lack of Understanding and Acceptance" they experience. Particularly, youth highlighted the lack of understanding of sensory needs and parents underscored the lack of understanding by medical professionals. In contrast, practitioners highlighted the presence of "Community Openness." Both practitioners and parents discussed "Finding Personal Support through Acceptance." Self-acceptance and acceptance of autism are imperative for autistic young adults and families to achieve well-being.

AB  - Research has shown educators' implicit biases to be a key factor in creating and perpetuating disparities in students' experiences of schooling, learning, and longer-term outcomes, including job opportunities, wealth, and health. Current school reform and transformation efforts are aimed at addressing institutionalized racism in school policies, practices, and cultural systems by implementing implicit bias training for teachers and staff. In this paper, we explain how a school home visits program, Parent Teacher Home Visits (PTHV), is a promising intervention for counteracting implicit biases and improving outcomes for families and students. The PTHV "relational" home visit model focuses on promoting mutually supportive and accountable relationships between educators and families. We present data from a study examining the experiences of 107 educators and 68 family members who participated in PTHV, showing how educators shifted their deficit assumptions about families and students. Although the PTHV model was not created to address implicit biases, we found that the key components of these home visits align with strategies that psychological research has demonstrated effectively counteracting implicit biases and reducing discriminatory behaviors.

AB  - Governmental policies in the United States and beyond increasingly call for school leaders to involve local communities in decision-making, yet engagement practices have often centered the perspectives of White parents and marginalized the voices of racially minoritized families. In this comparative case study of seven school districts, we draw on critical race theory to explore how race and racism shaped district practices under a statewide community engagement policy. Our findings suggest that, without careful attention to racial power and privilege, the implementation of community engagement policies may promote racism in practice, highlighting the need for culturally responsive approaches to engagement.

AB  - Background: This study investigates the stress that parents can experience as a result of raising children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities, in relation to various child and family characteristics and to families' social opportunities and social support. Method: A total of 225 parents of children with developmental and/or intellectual disabilities in Abu Dhabi Emirate completed a quantitative questionnaire. Results: Parental stress was significantly correlated with children's age and type of disability, with mothers' age, fathers' education, children's place of residence, number of children with disabilities in the family, family monthly income, social opportunities and social support, but with none of the other characteristics examined. Conclusions: Governmental and non-governmental organizations in the United Arab Emirates should take measures to improve the psychological well-being of parents of children with disabilities, a key intervention being the improvement of support services to such parents. Some cultural issues have been discussed.

AB  - Family involvement has been identified as a mechanism that explains the differences in academic performance and well-being between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The implications of family involvement in students' non-academic outcomes have often been overshadowed by a focus on the academic domain. This study focuses on one type of non-academic attributes which is currently most critical to navigate in school and beyond: social-emotional development. In addition to that, the potential mediating role of school engagement in the association between family involvement and students' social-emotional development remains to be explored. This study aimed to investigate whether family involvement was associated with students' school engagement and social-emotional development and to clarify the underlying mechanism in the relationship. The sample consisted of 170 students from 8 to 17 years old and their parents who live in economically vulnerable situations and experience social exclusion. The analyses were performed using Jamovi statistical software and a GLM Mediation Model module. To address the research objectives, a series of mediation analysis were performed to fit the hypothesized relations among the study variables. The mediational analysis suggested that home-based family involvement could not predict students' social-emotional development, and that the effect of home-based family involvement on students' social-emotional development was fully mediated by school engagement, a variable not included in previous research. The results suggest that families who are actively engaged in their child's education at home positively influence students' level of participation in school, which, in turn, promotes the development of students' social-emotional competences.

AB  - Using data from a nationally representative sample of 5-year-olds in the Growing Up in Ireland study (N = 9001, 51% male), this research investigated the role of factors in the neighborhood environment on levels of active outdoor play in young children. Primary caregivers (98% mothers; 81% Irish) responded to questions regarding their child's levels of active outdoor play (e.g., chasing) and their perceptions of their neighborhood (e.g., social cohesion and antisocial behavior). Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that levels of active outdoor play were associated with parental perceptions of neighborhood safety and traffic levels, even after other factors were controlled for (i.e., family income). The results are discussed from a bioecological systems perspective. Implications for policy makers and parents are considered.

AB  - Developmental studies have consistently argued for consideration of contextual influences on children's socioemotional well-being. This is particularly true among children of immigrants, who have highly diverse social, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten, this study disentangled the variation of socioemotional well-being among children of immigrants in the United States by looking at country of origin and their multifaceted economic experiences. The study first examined the economic lives of children of immigrants by conducting a latent class analysis with 3 dimensions--depth, duration, and income volatility from kindergarten to fifth grade. It further investigated how multifaceted economic experiences shaped the socioemotional perceptions of children of immigrants by considering country of origin. Findings from this study support both the immigrant risk and immigrant paradox perspectives, depending on country of origin, patterns of economic experiences, and the examined socioemotional domain. Children of immigrants generally perceived themselves to have a worse locus of control, self-concept, and internalizing symptoms at eighth grade than their peers of native-born parents. After considering the economic circumstances of these families, the picture was no longer straightforward. Children of South East Asian and East Asian origins reported worse socioemotional well-being than their White peers of native-born parents in chronic near-poor circumstances. Otherwise, most children of immigrants fared as well as their White children of native-born parents under similar economic conditions. Findings underscore the importance of country of origin and economic experiences in accounting for the variations of socioemotional well-being among children of immigrants.

AB  - Purpose: Adolescents' and parents' experiences within a multidimensional school-based physical activity intervention grounded on self-determination theory were explored. Method: Qualitative data from 29 adolescents (aged 15-17 years) and three parents on behalf of the total students' families were collected via participant observation (research diary), semistructured interviews, and focus groups. Results: Adolescents perceived that the application of motivational strategies, based on self-determination theory, satisfied their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, favored self-determined motivation, and gave rise to adaptive consequences (improved physical activity knowledge, creation of affective bonds, and increased leisure-time physical activity). These results were supported by the information reported by the students' parents. Discussion/Conclusions: The findings support the implementation of self-determination theory-based multidimensional interventions to promote adolescents' physical activity participation. This study also presents several motivational strategies which could be useful for the design and implementation of future school-based physical activity interventions.

AB  - Two instructors collaborated across programs in a School of Education to bring mixed reality simulation to preservice early childhood educators in an effort to utilize content knowledge to practice challenging conversations. The scenario chosen was a parent-teacher conference focused on supporting a child with disabilities in an inclusive early childhood preschool classroom. The authors discuss the process of implementing mixed reality simulation in Early Childhood Studies and potential implications for lifelong impact of family engagement throughout a child's schooling experiences and the use of mixed reality in teacher preparation. Interdisciplinary collaboration across programs within a school of education are considered.

AB  - Children and adolescents (henceforth "children") with both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety experience greater difficulties than children with either alone, though qualitative methodologies are yet to be used to understand the challenges this population experiences. We aimed to explore parent-reported daily impacts of co-occurring anxiety in children with ADHD (ages 8-13 years). Participants were enrolled in an Australian trial evaluating an adapted anxiety intervention and were eligible if their child met diagnostic criteria for ADHD plus separation, social, and/or generalized anxiety disorder. A baseline measure of life impacts associated with child anxiety captured situations parents reported were difficult, due to their child's anxiety. Reflexive thematic analysis of free-text responses (N = 203) facilitated new insights via inductively generating key themes. Three overarching themes highlighted (1) child difficulties with everyday situations and processes due to their anxiety; (2) the nature of the child's anxiety being pervasive and unrelenting; and (3) the strain placed on the child's family system. This study enhances understanding of daily impacts associated with co-occurring anxiety and ADHD and may contribute to an improved understanding of support needs. Results reiterate the need to identify co-occurring difficulties in children with ADHD and support both children and their families.

AB  - Background: There is a recognised need internationally to reduce depression and anxiety among adolescents. As a population particularly sensitive to the amount and quality of social interaction, challenges for young people became magnified during COVID-19, particularly for students from under-represented and marginalised communities across the globe. Purpose: This paper reports on a study conducted in Washington State, USA, that sought, via an alliance with students, parents, educators and community leaders, to gain insight into students' lived experiences during the pandemic. It aimed to better comprehend how experiences affected social emotional learning and use this understanding to explore ways of reducing students' mental health concerns. Method: We created a diverse consortium, drawn from six schools. It comprised 13 students, predominantly students of colour, across the age range 11-18 years. Also participating were five other stakeholders: parents, educators and community leaders. The consortium's involvement in five online discussion sessions led to the collection of rich data, as participants shared perspectives on pandemic experiences and learning. Additionally, we administered a survey about group collaboration. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: The formation of the consortium represented a significant outcome in itself, providing a meaningful way of gaining understanding of the mental health and social emotional concerns of the students, their families and the other collaborators. Another outcome was the opportunity for students and parents to be at the same table and voice concerns about remote learning, sharing views on how changes affected students' learning and mental health. Conclusion: The consortium allowed for all voices to be heard. This research highlights the need for more attention and resources to be directed towards students of colour, not only across schools within the research setting but also elsewhere internationally. The connection of students with educators, parents and community stakeholders, by means of a consortium, can build a foundation through which the mental health needs of students in school may be addressed in future research.

AB  - Because the COVID-19 pandemic has been implicated in increased mental health concerns for families of low income, we aimed to describe maternal perspectives about the pandemic's impact on their kindergartener's mental health during the 2020-2021 school year. We conducted 22 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with U.S. mothers with low income who had kindergarten-age children (50% male and 50% female). All participants were female, ranging in age from 24 to 44 years, and reported the following ethnic/racial identities: non-Hispanic Black or African American (41%), Hispanic of any race (36%) and non-Hispanic, White (23%). With a team comprising multiple researchers from varied disciplines (e.g., medicine, education and public health) our analytic process used an iterative approach for developing and revising codes and themes until we reached thematic saturation. Most mothers described negative impacts on social, behavioural and emotional aspects of mental health. Some described positive social impacts, including strengthened family relationships. Mothers described no positive changes to behavioural or emotional aspects of mental health. Maternal perspectives suggest the importance of prioritising access to screening and treating mental health needs to support children's kindergarten transition, mitigate pandemic impacts and plan for future disruptions.

AB  - International authors have argued that social class inequalities can influence parental engagement in education. Lareau argued that middle-class families possess the resources to actively cultivate their children to succeed academically, whereas working-class and poor families feel they lack such resources and allow their children to develop limited and passive relations with school. This article applies a core element of Lareau's typology of child rearing to examine disadvantaged British mothers' experience of engaging with schools. A study involving 77 parents and caregivers of secondary school children, considered disadvantaged, sought to understand the experiences of parental engagement in primary and secondary education. Selective case studies have been chosen from this larger study, using a thematic analysis, to understand how these mothers interpreted their experiences of engaging with secondary education, their feelings of frustration, powerlessness and distance from secondary school. The stories presented illustrate that the 'accomplishment of natural growth' provides a contemporary class analysis framework to interpret the experiences of some disadvantaged British parents. Recommendations are made advising how Lareau's typology of child rearing can inform policy and practice in the British education system and recommendations for future research are made with the purpose of promoting equal access to educational engagement and opportunities.

AB  - Suboptimal parenting characterized by low self-efficacy and perceived impact is associated with poor child mental health and academic outcomes, especially for at-risk families. This study capitalized on a longitudinal study conducted prior to and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to test how prior parenting cognitions and environmental risk factors predict mental health and educational challenges faced by children during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic parenting and environmental risk data are available for a sample of 252 low-income mother-child dyads in Toronto, Canada. Research Findings: Mothers who had lower parental self-efficacy, but higher perceived parental impact prior to COVID-19 reported that their children faced educational challenges during the pandemic. In addition, mothers who reported lower levels of pre-pandemic parental self-efficacy reported that their children were more likely to have emotional and conduct problems greater than the sample average during COVID-19. Practice or Policy: Parents with specific profiles of parenting cognitions may need additional support to help their children cope during the pandemic.

AB  - Advancing equity in early childhood education is crucial as our broader society faces issues of inequities across systems, including education. Professionals must honor children's home language and cultural contexts, coming from a perspective of value and respect rather than from a traditionally dominant Eurocentric perspective. Through this study, we share the perspectives of 22 U.S. parents of dual-language learners (DLLs) as they experienced an evaluation for preschool special education. Through a mixed-methods approach using survey and interview data, three primary themes emerged: (1) relationships and interactions; (2) home language and cultural context; and (3) the evaluation process. Significant differences in satisfaction emerged between those who had participated in Part C Early Intervention services versus those who had not.

AB  - Self-regulation in early childhood, including the ability to regulate one's own thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, are associated with a range of outcomes including academic performance, and social development. Research has extensively examined the effects of mother's parental involvement and parenting experiences, such as parenting stress and self-efficacy, on child self-regulation skills and overall development. Related work has additionally found that, in general, fathers make a unique contribution to child development. However, there is limited understanding about the parental involvement and parenting experiences of fathers and how those experiences are connected to the development of child self-regulation skills. This chapter will (1) explore the various ways in which father involvement is defined and measured within the literature, and (2) review the literature and early research on the influence father involvement can have in the development of child self-regulation. The study of father involvement is an ever-growing and evolving area of research as more is understood about the differences in parenting experiences including parenting stress, parenting self-efficacy, romantic relationship satisfaction, and coparenting satisfaction between mothers and fathers. How father involvement and parenting experiences can impact child development, particularly child self-regulation, is essential to understanding how to best support families and enhance educational success.

AB  - This paper reports the research findings from an online survey of parents of primary-age pupils in Northern Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of the study were to explore how parents supported their child/ren's home learning; to ascertain the communication, guidance and resources between home and school; and to learn from the experiences of parents to enable more effective practices to be established should similar circumstances arise in the future. The survey yielded 2,509 responses and highlighted the divergence of practices in relation to home-school communications across schools as well as the challenges experienced by parents, particularly those who had one or more children with special educational needs and/or those who had Free School Meal Entitlement. The study was guided by Epstein's Framework of the Six Types of Involvement, most specifically the spheres of "parenting," "learning from home," "communication," "collaborating with the community" and "decision-making." Within Epstein's framework, the challenges and tensions between family, school and work are explored. Recommendations are made that will be helpful to parents, schools, teacher-educators, policy-makers and researchers in informing the shape and delivery of education in Northern Ireland and internationally both during and following the challenge of the current COVID-19 pandemic and for similar situations that may arise in the future. The findings and conclusions are relevant not only to the Northern Ireland education context, but also make a valuable contribution to global dialogue on what this experience has revealed about inequities in education systems and how these should be addressed going forward.

AB  - The promotion of mathematical literacy depends on understanding the variables associated with mathematics learning. The purpose of the current research was to explore relationships between mathematics achievement with sources of mathematics self-efficacy and perceived mathematics achievement expectations of parents, teachers, and friends in middle school students. Participants of the research were 332 8th grade middle school students. The research findings showed that mastery experience, social persuasions, and family expectations significantly predicted mathematics achievement. Furthermore, the most powerful predictor of mathematics achievement was the mastery experience. In conclusion, mastery experience and social persuasions dimensions of sources of self-efficacy and mathematics achievement expectations from parents have associated effects on mathematics achievement.

AB  - COVID-19 not only threatens people's physical health, but also creates disruption in work and social relationships. Parents may even experience additional strain resulting from childcare responsibilities. A total of 129 parents participated in this study. Parents of children with developmental disorders showed higher levels of parenting stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms than did parents of children with typical development. Parenting stress and health worries were positively related to mental health symptoms. The association between having a child with developmental disorders and mental health symptoms was mediated by parenting stress. This study provides a timely investigation into the stress and mental health of parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications on web-based parenting skills interventions, online psychological support services, and family-friendly policy initiatives are discussed.

AB  - Over the past 10 years, identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) risk has dramatically increased due to the wide-spread implementation of screening programs; yet, there is limited understanding about parent perceptions and experiences during the time period when risk is identified, but prior to receiving a formal diagnosis--a period that can last months to years given the long wait-lists for formal ASD evaluations. The current study aimed to examine parent perceptions of family impact (i.e., the impact their child's behaviors have on the family) between the time of risk-identification and formal diagnosis among 277 children identified as at-risk for ASD through screening positive in primary care. We aimed to compare family impact among those whose child met diagnostic criteria for ASD and those who did not. Parents of children who received a non-ASD diagnosis reported a higher baseline level of family impact (F[1, 274] = 5.82, p = 0.017); however, perceived difficult child behavior was a stronger predictor of family impact (t[6] = 13.11, p < 0.001) than later diagnostic group (t[6] = - 2.10, p = 0.037), and child functioning did not predict family impact (t[6] = -0.31, p = 0.76). These results suggest that in this population, perceived difficult child behavior is a stronger predictor of family impact than later diagnostic category and should be considered an important factor in family support.

AB  - Parental separation not only impacts on family relationships, it also has implications for a child's school life and opportunity to learn. However, there is little understanding of how children of separated parents navigate the relationship between home and school. This paper reports findings from discussions with education professionals in English schools about their experience of issues children of separated parents face as they move between home and school. Schools are seen as safe spaces where children who 'have less supportive home lives' can access support to promote their emotional wellbeing (DfE, 2018, p13). This study found staff in primary school tended to be knowledgeable about children's situations, whereas in secondary school, issues came to attention only when parent(s) contacted the school, or through achild's behaviour. Good parental communication was seen as significant in enabling children to move between home and school with ease. Where parental conflict 'spilled over' into schools, staff became aware of the child's situation but did not always feel able to provide appropriate support. If children wanted to talk about their family situation with someone in school, professionals thought they should have this opportunity but questioned whether staff had appropriate knowledge and skills. The paper considers ways in which staff might support these children through the introduction of awhole school approach, the new Relationships Education curriculum, small group work and work with parents. The framework for understanding children's accommodation of parental separation was considered auseful tool that could support this work (Kay-Flowers, 2019a).

AB  - This study focuses on flexibly scheduled early childhood education and care (ECEC), an institutional childcare service for Finnish families where both parents, or a single parent, work non-standard hours. Although many countries nowadays offer extended hours day care, only Finland has a publicly provided, law-based system guaranteeing ECEC during non-standard as well as standard hours. We explore, drawing on parental survey data, what kinds of families use such services and when. Furthermore, we utilise web-survey data obtained from early educators to find out what they report as the main challenges involved in implementing flexibly scheduled ECEC. The results showed that single-parent families and lower educated parents were over-represented among the families using flexibly scheduled ECEC. The unpredictability of working-life tends to spill over to ECEC. Due to varying parental work schedules, children have unique daily and weekly rhythms, which in turn impact on administration, pedagogical issues and meeting children's needs.

AB  - Cross-national family is an understudied group. In the past, research on this group tended to focus on the challenges confronted by the couples in marital conflicts impacted by the unique stressors within the family including: place of residence, disparate language and cultural differences, societal attitudes, and extended families and friends. A relatively small proportion of the literature focused on multicultural parenting experiences which is recognized as a turning point for increasing conflicts within couples. Through surveys and selected interviews, this qualitative study provides insightful narrative descriptions to further understand how the unique stressors might impact childrearing experiences. Results describe parents' perceptions on their cross-national marriages and multicultural parenting experiences.

AB  - Knowledge and identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are increasing in Latin America, yet there are limited resources available to help families of children with ASD. For this study, researchers adapted and tested a parent educational program created for Latino immigrant parents of children with ASD in the United States to the needs of parents of children with ASD in Colombia. Parents were randomized into two intervention delivery modes, one led by parents and the other by students. All measures were self-reported by parents (n = 20). Parents improved in understanding their child's strengths and needs and frequency of using evidence-based strategies. Parents in the student-led group reported significantly lower depressive symptoms between baseline and follow-up. In focus groups, parents expressed satisfaction with the intervention and described ways they were using the information. This study demonstrated promising results to improve the experience of parents of children with ASD in Colombia.

AB  - The inclusive education debate is often framed as a choice between outmoded special schools and progressive inclusive general education schools. However, the rhetoric of 'choice' hides what is in reality a context of restricted resources, both in general education and in special congregated settings. We interview three deaf-parented families with a total of six deaf children enrolled in different educational settings in Belgium. We explore the educational choices parents made for their children and how these choices are influenced (1) by their own knowledge of and lived experience with the educational choices available and (2) actually existing resources. Our study shows a clear contrast between the capital parents bring to their children's educational experiences and the choices available. Parents want to send their children to congregated settings to give them an education in sign language but are hindered from doing so because of the schools' lack of adherence to educational standards. Instead they are pushed into a general education system that tasks their time and energy, as well as their child's bodies. The paucity of options for these parents calls for a rethinking of the parameters of the inclusive education debate, moving beyond placement to a holistic focus on deaf children's linguistic, educational, and social development.

AB  - Sleeping difficulties among adolescents constitute a pressing public health issue, and it is of the utmost importance that these are approached from a health-promotion perspective. This study explores adolescents' suggestions on how their sleep could be supported. Data were collected via eight focus group interviews with 43 adolescents aged 15-16, in Sweden, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The results describe the adolescents' suggestions on how their sleep could be supported in three themes: being supported by involved parents--routines, engagement, and warmth are vital; being supported to achieve knowledge on the "whys" and "hows" of sleep--increased knowledge gives the ability to make well-grounded sleep choices; and being guided into finding balance--balance in life is difficult to achieve and adolescents desire support. Parents, school nurses, health professionals, and anyone who has the opportunity to improve and promote sleep should consider adolescents' suggestions.

AB  - The association between school emotional engagement and child mental health and school success highlights the importance of understanding how child-school relations are developed and what factors are related to this affective process during the initial years of schooling so that early intervention is possible. This study examined emotional engagement in Portuguese children attending elementary school and aimed to identify and characterize subgroups based on the child's school liking and avoidance, using a model-based cluster analysis. In addition, differences between clusters in what concerns individual (self-efficacy, behavioral engagement, externalizing, and internalizing problems), family (parental emotional support), school (teacher-student closeness), and family-school relation (parental school involvement) variables were analyzed. The sample consisted of 394 elementary school children, 353 parents, and 35 teachers using a multimethod assessment (i.e. children, parents, and teachers' reports). Cluster analysis identified three patterns of emotional school involvement: emotionally involved, emotionally involved with some avoidance, and emotionally ambivalent. Results showed that many children experience ambivalent feelings toward school in the first years of schooling. The emotionally ambivalent group stood out negatively from the other groups concerning self--efficacy, behavioral engagement, externalizing, and internalizing problems. Suggestions for future research and practical implications for schools are discussed.

AB  - The article presents preliminary findings from a family survey about children's experiences during the COVID-19 lockdown, which was administered through the pediatric network SICuPP (Italian Society of Primary Care Pediatricians -- Lombardy) in Northern Italy. The study involved 3443 parents with children aged from 1 to 5 years and from 6 to 10 years living in Lombardy region, the earliest and most severely affected by the COVID-19 emergency. All participants completed an online questionnaire and provided informed consent. Respondents generally displayed confidence and a sense of self-efficacy in relation to how they had coped with the COVID-19 emergency, despite the many difficulties encountered during the lockdown. They reported having observed some unexpected improvements and resources (e.g. parent/child and sibling relationships, adaptiveness and autonomy on the part of children). Parent-to-parent solidarity was commonly reported, although a small percentage of parents had experienced a greater sense of isolation and anxiety. Finally, the study indicated 'key areas of vulnerability' (concerning, for example, eating, rules, sleeping, use of technological devices, fears …) that should be monitored in future by strengthening the territorial network linking families, educational services, and health services.

AB  - This study was conducted in Austria with Indian immigrant mothers to understand their perceptions and experiences about family involvement in education. Family involvement in education can promote a wide range of benefits for all, and especially for immigrant children. The qualitativeinterpretative research methodology was adopted, and ten mothers participated in the research through semi-structured interviews. The constant-comparative data analysis policy made it possible to adapt the following interviews based on the emerging domains. The data analysis yielded four domains, including the meaning of family involvement, barriers to family involvement, the support systems for family involvement, and being involved as an immigrant parent. The findings showed that the cultural capital of parents has a significant impact on the understandings of family involvement for immigrant parents. On the other hand, the support that the families get is limited to the support provided by teachers. However, this type of support is understood as encouragement and is highly appreciated by parents. Lastly, being an immigrant adds up to the challenges due to a lack of knowledge about the culture of school-parent communication even after long years of being a resident in the country.

AB  - The present study examined the concurrent relations between culture-specific dimensions of family engagement for low-income, Pan-Latine families and children's narrative ability, a critical predictor of reading success. One hundred seventy-five children and their caregivers were recruited from seven Head Start centers in a large city in the northeastern region of the US. Family engagement was assessed through a culturally grounded instrument (McWayne et al. 2013; McWayne and Melzi 2014) that measures parental behavior along one school-based and three home-based engagement dimensions. Children's spontaneous narrative productions were elicited through two tasks: a picture-elicited and a conversational narrative task. Findings showed that family engagement dimensions were differentially related to important aspects of children's narrative production, even after accounting for child and parent demographic characteristics. Specifically, families' efforts to provide stimulating experiences for their children beyond "the basics" (i.e., "Supplemental Education") were significantly related to children's ability to tell longer narratives during the picture-elicited narrative task. In addition, parents' active school-based engagement (i.e., "School Participation") was significantly associated with children's ability to narrate independently in the conversational narrative task.
